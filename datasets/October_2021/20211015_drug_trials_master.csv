Effective early treatments that account for ADHD symptoms have not been developed for young children with ASD+ADHD. The overarching goals of this randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2, pilot study are to (1) evaluate a novel early intervention that pharmacologically addresses ADHD symptoms while providing an ASD-targeted behavioral intervention, and (2) identify changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie improved outcomes in children with comorbid ASD and ADHD ages 3-10 years. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether a stimulant treatment augments efficacy of an ASD specific form of parent child therapy based on the Early Start Denver Model called ESDM influenced Parent Coaching. Secondary aims are to determine the efficacy of combined intervention in improving ADHD symptoms and the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Adzenys-XR-ODT in young children with ASD+ADHD. The study will also examine correlations between behavioral changes and state-of-the-art eye-gaze tracking (EGT) and electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers to elucidate key ways in which ADHD impacts attentional and neural functioning in ASD+ADHD, and to potentially identify new targets for intervention in children with ASD+ADHD. The study is about 8 months long and will involve screening, baseline assessment followed by 10- 11 weeks of study drug treatment (active or placebo) and 8 sessions of ESDM informed parent coaching beginning after 2 weeks of study drug treatment, primary endpoint assessments at ~11 weeks, AE follow-up by phone at ~week 13 and remote FU 24 weeks after baseline.

The core symptoms of ASD are deficits in social communication and the presence of repetitive and restricted behaviours and interests, including sensory anomalies. Currently, there are no effective medical treatments for the core symptoms of ASD, and families frequently use costly non evidence based interventions. Developing drugs for ASD has been challenging because of a limited understanding of its underlying pathophysiology(ies), and difficulties modelling it in vitro and in vivo.||A recent study from EU-AIMS reported, for the first time in ASD, that differences in E-I balance can be 'shifted' using a GABA acting drug (riluzole), and that abnormalities in functional connectivity can be 'normalised' by targeting E-I, even in adults. This offers promise that drugs targeting specific parts of the GABA pathway may improve symptoms.||The aim of the investigator's project is to conduct a double-blind Randomized Control Trial (RCT) focused on GABA/glutamate equilibrium, to assess the efficacy of a drug that targets core and/or comorbid symptoms in ASD. Arbaclofen is a selective GABA-B receptor agonist and augments GABA-ergic activity, inhibits presynaptic release of glutamate, inhibits postsynaptic transmission, and modulates intracellular signalling. Through elevation of GABA-ergic inhibitory activity, Arbaclofen may act to alleviate ASD symptoms with social anxiety and emotional hyperarousal.||Hypothesis: Arbaclofen will be superior to placebo in improving social function as measured by the Vineland-3 social domain.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Signed Written Informed Consent||Participants or their legal representative must have signed and dated an IRB/IEC approved written informed consent form in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines.

Parents of potential subjects will do a preliminary phone screen, followed by a clinical evaluation by a psychiatrist for possible inclusion in the study. Informed written consent and assent will be obtained from the parents and subjects respectively once deemed competent and before the initiation of any study procedures.||Clinical Evaluation will use the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) to establish a formal diagnosis.||Study Procedures Baseline Assessments: Many baseline measures for physical health will be done at the screening visit and during the first weekly visit. These will include a clinical interview, physical and neurological examination will be done during the screening period and height, weight and vital signs, and a calculation of his/her Body Mass Index (BMI) will be done during the screening period and during the first weekly visit. Laboratory measures at baseline and study completion will include a complete metabolic panel (with liver transaminases) and complete blood count with differential. Further measures will include a fasting lipid profile, hemoglobin A1C, prolactin level and insulin levels, and fasting blood sugar level (FBS). Serum albumin will be measured not only as a measure of nutritional state, but also in accordance with the fact that aripiprazole is 99% protein-bound. An electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed at the beginning and end of the study to monitor for possible cardiac effects. These measures are aimed at monitoring side effects reported in the use of other medications in this class. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed for each female subject at the beginning and end of the study.||Outcome measures will include the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale for children (BPRS-C), Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S), Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) and the Atypical Children's Development Scale (ACDS).||Baseline parameters for extrapyramidal side effects will be established using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), the Simpson Angus Extrapyramidal Side Effect Scale (SAEPS) and the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale. Baseline values for general side effects will be compiled using the Monitoring of Side Effects System (MOSES).||Weekly visits: At all visits, patients will undergo a clinical interview, vital signs, and weight measures. Custodial guardian(s) will provide collateral information. The weekly ""short"" visits will occur at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. They will be about 45 minutes in duration.||Ongoing outcome measures will be performed at visits 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11. The visits will be about 1-1.5 hours in duration. The measures done will include those at the short visits, as well as the Y-BOCS, BPRS, ABC and CGI-S. Side effects will be monitored using the AIMS, SAEPS, Barnes Akathisia Scale and MOSES at these visits.||Termination Visit: The last visit (Visit 13 or earlier if patient drops out of the study) will include the repetition of all measures at visit 1 (except the ADI-R) and will last about 2 hours. All baseline laboratory measures will be repeated at this time.||Follow-Up Patient Care: After completion of the clinical trial, the patients will be followed at the Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA) Center for Child and Adolescent Development until they can be referred back to their original psychiatric providers or to appropriate treatment providers in the community.||Medication dosing: Aripiprazole will be started at 2.5mg or 5mg depending on clinical impression and severity of especially aggression and agitation. At the weekly visits, the dose will be adjusted in not more than 5mg increments according to clinical impression. The lowest effective dose will be used, up to a maximum dose of 20mg.||Patients already taking psychotropic medications will be tapered off their medications during the first 1-2 weeks of the study. The dose will be reduced to 67% of the initial dose for 3 days and then to 33% of the initial dose for 3 days and then the medication(s) will be discontinued. The subjects will remain off of on enrollment medications for 5 half lives and then aripiprazole will be initiated. Anticonvulsant medications taken for seizure control may be continued throughout the trial as long as the subject has been on a stable dose for 30 days prior to the study and has been seizure free for 6 months. These medication doses will be held stable throughout the trial.||Adverse Events: Any serious adverse event leading to hospitalization will lead to study discontinuation. Any event requiring concomitant medication(s) will also lead to discontinuation. Adverse events will be reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) if there is an event requiring medical attention, or scores 3 or higher on the MOSES scale.

SPECIFIC AIM||To obtain pilot data regarding the safety, dosing, and efficacy of open-labeled aripiprazole in children, aged 12 to 18 years, diagnosed with autism. A larger, more controlled trial will be planned for this population if the drug is safe and tends to be efficacious.||II. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE||Autism is a serious disorder that first presents in childhood, usually before three years of age (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Though the incidence of autism is low (approximately 3-6 cases per 10,000 live births), the consequences of the disorder are severe. As the term ""pervasive"" implies, the symptoms affect most areas of functioning in the developing child, and the disabilities associated with the disorder tend to persist throughout life. Symptoms of autism include abnormalities in social relatedness including extreme withdrawal; communication including no or little speech; and a sameness or repetitiveness in behaviors and interests. Children diagnosed with autism can have severe problems including hyperactivity, lability of mood, irritability, withdrawal, and stereotypical behavior. Because of these severe problems, treatment of symptomatology often includes pharmacotherapy.||The most studied drug for treating children and adolescents with autism is the typical neuroleptic, haloperidol (Anderson et al, 1989; Anderson et al, 1984; Campbell et al, 1978; and Cohen et al, 1980). The main public health concern regarding the use of haloperidol is the risk of inducing dyskinesias (Campbell et al, 1988, 1997), though the dyskinesias have been reversible.||Evidence also suggests that atypical neuroleptics, such as olanzapine (Horrigan et al, 1997b; Malone et al, 2001; Potenza et al, 1999) and risperidone (Demb, 1996; Findling et al, 1997; Fisman and Steele, 1996; Hardan et al, 1996; Horrigan et al, 1997a; Malone et al, 1999b; McDougle et al, 1997; Nicholson et al, 1998; Perry et al, 1997) are effective. But the weight gain associated with these agents can be a considerable health risk (Pi-Sunyer, 1993; Sjostrom, 1992). For example, olanzapine use has reportedly been associated with increased blood glucose (Fertig et al, 1998; Gatta et al, 1999; Ober et al, 1999; Wirshing et al, 1998; Yazici et al, 1998). Ziprasidone is associated with increases in QTc, including in children (Malone, unpublished data).||Aripiprazole, a recently released atypical agent is likely to be as effective as other neuroleptics in autism, but may have the considerable health advantage of not causing weight gain. However, because there is a lack of safety and efficacy data with aripiprazole in children with autism, an open pilot study of aripiprazole in this population is indicated.||III. DESIGN AND METHODS||A. Setting: The setting for this study will be the Specialty Clinic for Pervasive Developmental Disorders, part of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic of Drexel University College of Medicine located at Friends Hospital.||B. Subjects: Subjects will be 15 children and adolescents who meet the DSM-IV Criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorder.||C. Design: This is a 6-week pilot study employing open treatment with aripiprazole. Subjects will be rated at baseline and thereafter assessed weekly.||D. Medication: Subjects will be treated openly with aripiprazole. Should untoward effects occur, the dosage of the medication will be reduced or the medication will be discontinued, as clinically appropriate. Subjects will not receive other concomitant psychotropic medication during the study. Medication will be taken concomitant with food.||Aripiprazole Dosing Strategy: Aripiprazole tablets (10, 15, 20, and 30 mg) will be employed for the study. The dosage range for aripiprazole will be 5 mg/day to 30 mg/day. Every effort will be made to reach and maintain a therapeutic dosage by week four of the treatment phase.||For subjects who weigh less than 25 kg, starting dosage will be 5 mg/every other day. After 3 days, the dosage can be increased to 5 mg. By week 2, subjects can be increased up to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 10 mg increments weekly.|For subjects who weigh greater than 25 kg, the starting dosage will be 5 mg/day. After three days, the dosage can be increased to 10 mg/day. By week two, subjects can be increased to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 10 mg increments weekly as needed.||Note: Should 5 mg tablets not be available, the dosing schedule will employ ½ of a 10 mg tablet and dosage increases will be made in 10 mg increments. We are starting at a 5 mg dosage to avert excessive sedation at onset of drug administration.||F. Measures||Primary efficacy measure: The Clinical Global Impressions (CGI; Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The efficacy of treatments can be judged on their ability to enhance global functioning, an assessment that is particularly relative in a pilot study. The CGI consists of three global scales measuring severity of illness, global improvement, and drug effect, and has been useful in measuring drug treatment effect in this population (see Campbell and Palij, 1985). The PI and another trained rater will complete this scale. Although only members of the research team generally complete this scale, it will additionally be completed by the subject's parent/caretaker. Having it completed by the parent/caretaker will take only minutes and may result in useful data. This measure will be completed weekly beginning at baseline.|Secondary efficacy measure: Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale (Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The CPRS was developed by the Psychopharmacology Branch of the NIMH to rate childhood psychopathology. Each of the items is rated from ""1"" (not present) to ""7"" (extremely severe). The first 28 items of this scale require no verbal response on the part of the subject, making them appropriate for rating children and adolescents with Pervasive Developmental Disorder. Of these 28 items, 14 are particularly relevant in autism (see Campbell and Palij, 1985): they assess the symptoms for which drug treatment is indicated including hyperactivity, aggression, self-abusive behavior, temper tantrums, lability of mood, irritability, social withdrawal, and stereotypies. A composite sum of these 14 items, the CPRS-14, will be constructed and employed as a secondary outcome measure, a procedure used by a number of investigators (Anderson et al, 1989; Campbell et al, 1986, 1989, 1993; Findling et al, 1997; Sanchez et al, 1996). We analyzed our data using the CPRS-14; the ICC was 0.8978. In addition, 4 factors derived from these 14 items will be examined. They include: autism, anger/uncooperativeness, hyperactivity, and speech deviance (Overall and Campbell, 1988). This measure will be completed at baseline and at the end of treatment.|Safety measures: (1) A physical exam will be completed at baseline. (2) Height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse will be obtained and recorded at baseline and at each visit during the study. (3) The following laboratory measures will be obtained at baseline and repeated at the end of the treatment phase: complete blood count with differential, liver functions, and electrocardiogram. Serum prolactin will be obtained at baseline and at the end of the treatment phase. Any other clinically appropriate tests and evaluations will also be completed whenever needed.||Untoward effects will be measured and recorded at each visit employing the following measures: (1) Dosage Record and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (DOTES); (2) Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale (TESS); (3) Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) (all from Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985); and (4) the Neurologic Rating Scale (Simpson and Angus, 1970). The DOTES and TESS measure a wide range of possible untoward effects. The AIMS measures dyskinesias. The Neurologic Rating Scale measures other forms of extrapyramidal effects that can occur with neuroleptics such as dystonias, parkinsonian effects, and akathisia.||G. Procedures: All patients appropriate to the study and their parent/caretakers will be approached and informed consent and assent (in subjects under 14 years) will be obtained. Subjects meeting the Inclusion Criteria, but not the Exclusion Criteria, will enter the baseline period of the study.||Baseline (week 0): Subjects will be rated at baseline employing the CGI and the CPRS.||End of Treatment (week 6): At the end of the treatment period, subjects will again be rated employing the CGI and the CPRS (selected items).||In addition, each subject will be rated on the CGI at each visit so that data from the last visit is available should the subject terminate the study prematurely. If it is known that a subject will terminate the study at a visit before week 6, the subject will be rated with the CGI and the CPRS at that visit.||All safety measures will be completed at each visit. Laboratory measures and EKG will be obtained in the morning.||H. Analysis: This is a pilot study whose purpose is to get initial safety and efficacy data with aripiprazole in children with autism. We will perform an ANOVA, repeated measures, for CGI severity scores, the CPRS-14 and the CPRS factors. Similar analyses will be performed for safety measures including for weight, prolactin and other laboratory measures, and EKG indices.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Diagnosis of autism (DSM-IV) made by a boarded child and adolescent psychiatrist.|Males and females.|Aged 12 to 18 years.|Clinical judgment that medication treatment for autism is indicated.||Exclusion Criteria:||Major medical problems including cardiac, liver, endocrine, or renal diseases.|Uncontrolled seizures.|Baseline QTC greater than 425 msec.|Concomitant treatment with psychotropic medication.|History of prior exposure to aripiprazole.",11,Actual,,,,,,All,No,No,1 Open Label,"Aripiprazole 5 mg to 30mg, individually titrated",Aripiprazole,Abilify,Drug,,,30-Jul-18,Actual,27-Jul-18,OTHER,Drexel University College of Medicine,Philadelphia,,,United States,Drexel University College of Medicine at Friends Hospital,Pennsylvania,,18 Years,12 Years,Aripiprazole in Children With Autism: A Pilot Study,OTHER,Drexel University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Drexel University College of Medicine,Completed,Yes,Phase 2,16-Nov-11,Actual,,Clinical Global Impressions,Week 6,,,,,,Sponsor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4-Feb,,18-Jul,Child|Adult,21-Sep-05,Estimate,13-Sep-05,13-Sep-05,,Interventional,15-Oct-21,,No

Research suggests that a dysregulation of the dopamine and serotonin systems contributes to these interfering behaviors in individuals with PDD.

However, the atypical antipsychotics have also been associated with adverse effects. Thus there remains a need for a novel pharmacotherapy that would be safe and effective for children and adolescents with PDDs.

Research suggests that a dysregulation of the dopamine and serotonin systems contributes to these interfering behaviors in individuals with PDD. After benefits of typical neuroleptics were reported in subjects with PDD's, research shifted to the atypical antipsychotics, which have been shown to be better tolerated and effective in this population. However, the atypical antipsychotics have also been associated with adverse effects. Thus there remains a need for a novel pharmacotherapy that would be safe and effective for children and adolescents with PDD's including Asperger's disorder and PDD Not Otherwise Specified (PDD NOS). We hypothesize that aripiprazole will be effective for reducing aggression and repetitive behavior. We also hypothesize that aripiprazole will be well tolerated, with low risk for extrapyramidal symptoms, hyperprolactinemia, weight gain, or corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation.

AEs (SAEs), and AEs leading to study discontinuation. AE is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition. SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a cancer, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, results in the development of drug dependency or drug abuse, is an important medical event.|The SAS is a 10-item instrument used to evaluate the presence and severity of parkinsonian symptomatology. It is the most commonly used rating scale for Parkinsonism in clinical trials over the past 25 years. The ten items focus on rigidity rather than bradykinesia, and do not assess subjective rigidity or slowness. Items are rated for severity on a 0-4 scale, with definitions given for each anchor point. The total SAS Score has a possible range from 10 to 50. Negative change scores indicate improvement.|The AIMS is an assessment of movement dysfunctions. It is a 12-item instrument assessing abnormal involuntary movements associated with antipsychotic drugs and 'spontaneous' motor disturbance related to the illness itself. Scoring the AIMS consists of rating the severity of movement in 3 main anatomic areas (facial/oral, extremities, and trunk), based on a five-point scale (0=none, 4=severe). The AIMS Total Score has a possible range from 0 to 28. Negative change scores indicate improvement in movement dysfunction.|The Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale is a 4-item scale to assess presence and severity of drug-induced akathisia, including both objective items and subjective items, together with a global clinical assessment of akathisia.

A wide range of symptoms accompany autism, including self-injurious behavior, aggression, and severe tantrums. Despite an improved ability to reduce these symptoms, existing drug treatments continue to be associated with adverse side effects. Also, there is no existing drug treatment that reliably improves social behavior, a core deficit in autism. Studies on drug treatment combinations that are designed to reduce self-injurious behavior, aggression, and severe tantrums and improve social behavior in children with autism have yet to be conducted. This study will address the above-mentioned limitations by evaluating aripiprazole in reducing self-injurious behavior, aggression, and severe tantrums and by evaluating the addition of D-Cycloserine in improving social behavior among children with autism.||This study will include three phases and an add-on component for some children. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either aripiprazole or a placebo treatment for 8 weeks. Assessments measuring irritability, behavior, and social skills will be conducted at the end of this first phase. Those patients who respond well to aripiprazole will continue to receive aripiprazole treatment for another 16 weeks. This second phase will determine whether aripiprazole is associated with long-term maintenance of symptomatic improvement in patients who respond well to short-term treatment. Assessments will again be conducted at the end of this 16-week period. Those patients whose symptoms have stabilized and continue to improve while on aripiprazole will be asked to participate in the final phase of this study. During the this pilot phase, D-Cycloserine will be added to ongoing treatment with aripiprazole. Patients will take both aripiprazole and D-Cycloserine for an additional 8 weeks to determine if this combination of drug treatments results in improved social behavior once patients' aggression and self-injurious behavior have been stabilized with aripiprazole. At the end of this 8-week period, participants will be assessed for any changes in behavior, irritability, or social skills.

It is usually first diagnosed in early childhood. Children with autism demonstrate repetitive behaviors or interests and deficits in social interaction, verbal communication, and nonverbal communication. In addition, they often have unusual responses to sensory experiences, such as certain sounds or the way objects look. Some symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, are also associated with autism. Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is used to treat ADHD. It works differently, however, than stimulant drugs and may help to reduce ADHD symptoms in children with autism. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of atomoxetine in treating children with ADHD symptoms associated with autism.||Potential participants will first attend a screening visit, which will include a psychiatric diagnostic interview, a practice session for swallowing pill capsules, a physical exam, an electrocardiogram (ECG), a blood test, and an assessment of pubertal stage. Females of childbearing age will also undergo a urine pregnancy test. In an initial double-blind study phase, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive either atomoxetine or placebo for 8 weeks. A baseline visit will include several rating scales, observations, and an interview to assess adaptive functioning. These measures and procedures will be used to keep track of symptoms, side effects, and behavior that could change during the study. Children who are assigned to placebo and do not notice an improvement in their ADHD symptoms will be given the opportunity to receive atomoxetine at the end of 8 weeks. Study visits will occur once a week for 4 weeks, and then every other week for the remainder of the 8 weeks. During these visits, many of the baseline questionnaires and interviews will be repeated. At the Week 8 visit, the physical exam, ECG, blood tests, and some baseline questionnaires will also be repeated. All children who respond well to atomoxetine may continue taking the drug for an additional 10 months. During this time, participants will report to the clinic once a month for the first 4 months, then once at the end of 7 months, and finally once at the end of 10 months.

The range of scores per subscale are: Social Withdrawal/Lethargy 0-48; Stereotypy 0-21; Irritability 0-45; Hyperactivity 0-48; Inappropriate Speech 0-12. Parent ratings occur every 2 weeks during the study. Estimates are adjusted for baseline score, study stratum, and site, which were set at their sample means.|The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) is completed by the parent in order to assess whether additional improvements in social functioning occur with atomoxetine, as observed in our pilot study. This 65-item questionnaire will be completed at baseline and at the end of 8 weeks. The SRS is a standardized measure of the core symptoms of autism. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale. The score of each item is summed to create a total score. Total score results as follows: 0-62: within normal limits; 63-79 mild range of impairment; 80-108: moderate range of impairment; 109-149: severe range of impairment. Estimates are adjusted for baseline score, study stratum, and site, which were set at their sample means.|The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (VABS) is used to assess adaptive functioning in four domains: Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, and Motor Skills. This is a well-standardized open-ended interview used to assess the overall functioning of children and adults. This measure is especially important for subjects with PDDs given that their intellectual level is not always comparable to their adaptive functioning. The Vineland Maladaptive Behavior subscales will be included with these measures as these have been shown to be responsive to drug effects in other clinical trials in this population. The VABS will be done at baseline and at the end of 8 weeks. The composite score represents a standard score (mean = 100 and standard deviation of 15; range = 20-160) on which higher scores indicate a higher level of adaptive functioning. Estimates are adjusted for baseline score, study stratum, and site, which were set at their sample means.|Quality of life is assessed with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL 4.0). This instrument is well-validated and widely used for measuring health-related quality of life in children and adolescents. It also appears to be a valid instrument for use with children with psychiatric disorders. The Generic Core scales include 23 items. The health related and family functioning scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. The Family Impact module will be included to assess any change in family functioning. This will be completed at baseline and at the end of 8 weeks. Estimates are adjusted for baseline score, study stratum, and site, which were set at their sample means.|Since the ABC does not have items which directly assess anxiety, the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) is administered at week 8 during the study as an exploratory measure. The PARS is a clinician-rated instrument that assesses anxiety symptoms that are commonly associated with social anxiety, separation anxiety, and generalized anxiety disorders. Scaled score ranges form 0-25 with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety symptoms. Estimates are adjusted for baseline score, study stratum, and site, which were set at their sample means.|The Clinical Global Impressions Global Improvement (CGI-I) is designed to take into account all factors to arrive at an assessment of response to treatment. The CGI-I scale ranges from 1 to 7 (1=very much improved; 2= much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; 7=very much worse), with lower scores indicating improvement (1=very much improved and 2=much improved). Participants with a CGI-I score of 1 or 2 were classified as improved. Odds of improvement at 8 weeks were estimated using a repeated measures logistic regression model adjusting for baseline severity, study stratum, and site. The CGI-I was administered biweekly during the study. The CGI was focused on the target symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.|The ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) is an 18-item scale directly derived from DSM-IV criteria for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder with established reliability, validity and sensitivity to change. The ADHD-RS-IV is investigator-administered biweekly during the 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of the study. The scale consists of 2 subscales: inattention (9 items) and hyperactivity-impulsivity (9 items). If 3 or more items are skipped, the clinician should use extreme caution in interpreting the scale. Results from this rating scale alone should not be used to make a diagnosis. The total score can range form 0 to 54, with a higher score indicating greater severity. Change will be determined from the start of the open-label trial to 8 weeks post-start.|The ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) is an 18-item scale directly derived from DSM-IV criteria for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder with established reliability, validity and sensitivity to change.

Individual item scores range from 1 (completely agree) to 6 (completely disagree). Total scores range from 123 to 738.|Focused attention assessed distractibility. Child needs to identify a specific target (eg, Cherry); non-target is any other fruit. Child presses ""yes"" when target occurs in relevant position (eg, one of vertical positions on diamond). Child presses ""no"" when target is absent, or when target appears on horizontal position (irrelevant target). Error rates are percentage of missing relevant targets and percentage of false alarms in response to (irr)relevant (non)targets based on number of errors/total number of trials X 100.|Task is the same as described in Outcome Measure #10. Reaction times (RT) for hits are mean RTs of correct responses to relevant targets. RTs for correct rejections are mean RTs for correct rejections are mean RTs for correct no responses to irrelevant targets and relevant nontargets.|Task is the same as described in Outcome Measure #10. Standard deviations of reaction times (RT) assess intraindividual variability in RT and refer to the same conditions as those for mean reaction times described in Outcome Measure #11.|The memory search task aims at measuring serial search processes to be carried out in working memory. There are 2 blocks (loads) with 40 trials each. Load 1 has 1 target to identify (e.g., an animal). A ""yes"" is required whenever the target is part of the displayed set of four stimuli (all animals). Load 2 has 2 targets. Whenever 1 of the targets appears in the successively displayed sets of four animals, a ""yes"" is required. Targets are present in 50% of trials. Error rates are the percentages of errors made in each task condition, based on the number of errors/total number of trials X 100.|Memory search task aims at measuring serial search processes to be carried out in working memory.

This is a double-blind placebo, parallel study where the atomoxetine will have a dose titration over a 6 week period. All children will be seen weekly during this titration period, with additional visits at Week 8 and Week 10. Families assigned to the PMT arm will have an additional weekly meeting with a clinician for a total of 9 PMT visits. PMT involves teaching parents to implement behavioral interventions with their children. Subjects who are clinical responders (ADHD Responders and Compliance Responders) from the 10 week study period will be followed every 4 weeks in a 24-week extension study. Subjects who are clinical nonresponders will continue in PMT if they received PMT during the double-blind phase, and they will receive an open trial of atomoxetine if they were on placebo during the double-blind phase. All subjects (responders and nonresponders) will be invited to participate in follow-up assessments every 4 weeks for 24 weeks after the completion of the double-blind phase.","Atomoxetine, Placebo and Parent Management Training in Autism",,,14-Apr,Actual,Autism|Pervasive Development Disorder|Asperger's Disorder|Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,Hyperactivity|Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|Autism|Pervasive Development Disorders|Asperger's Disorder|Pervasive Development Disorders,D000006948|D000004194|D000001321|D000001289|D000020817|D000002659|D000067877,"Hyperkinesis|Disease|Autistic Disorder|Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity|Asperger Syndrome|Child Development Disorders, Pervasive|Autism Spectrum Disorder",Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Triple,,Treatment,Participant|Care Provider|Investigator,,,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Children 5 yrs to 14 years 11 mos with clinical diagnosis of Autism, Asperger's Disorder, or PDDNOS based upon the ADI-R and clinical evaluation by DSM-IV criteria,|Mental age equal to or greater than 24 months,|ADHD symptoms based upon the CASI and clinical confirmed diagnosis,|CGIS-S rating of 4 or grater for ADHD symptoms,|A mean item score of >1.5 on both the Parent and Teacher (non-parent caregiver) SNAP-IV 18 ADHD symptoms or the 9-symptom hyperactive-impulsive subscale (symptoms must be cross-situational),|Reliable care provider available to bring subject to clinic visits and weekly sessions.||Exclusion Criteria:||DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder psychotic disorder NOS,bipolar disorder, or major depression (if accompanied by a family history of bipolar disorder) based upon evidence of suicidality, CASI, and clinical interview/history,|Prior failed adequate trial of atomoxetine,|Use of other psychotropic medications that produce CNS effects,|Diagnosis of bipolar disorder, major depression, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, narrow angle glaucoma, other significant physical illness,|Pregnancy or sexually active females (intercourse in the past 6 months, reported by either the subject or caregiver),|Currently on effective medication treatment for ADHD,|Prior involvement in Parent Management Training or other similar program,|Currently on albuterol or taking beta blockers,|Taking supplements or other complementary medical treatments where dose cannot be held at current level for duration of study",128,Actual,,,0,10 weeks,,All,No,,1|2|3|4|1|3,atomoxetine|Placebo + parent management treatment,atomoxetine|Placebo|Parent Management Training,,Drug|Drug|Behavioral,,,4-Feb-16,Estimate,5-Jan-16,OTHER,University of Rochester,Rochester|Columbus|Pittsburgh,,,United States|United States|United States,University of Rochester Medical Center|Ohio State University|University of Pittsburgh Medical Center,New York|Ohio|Pennsylvania,,14 Years,5 Years,"Atomoxetine, Placebo and Parent Management Training in Autism",OTHER,University of Rochester,27|29|30|18|19|20|19|11|14|10|7|9|10|3|3|4|2|4,63|62|63|62|63|62|63|62|63|62|63|62|63|62|63|62|63|62,,Irritability|Decreased Appetite|Agitation|Difficulty sleeping|Vomiting|Constipation|Abdominal pain|Diarrhea|Aggression,,,,,2-Sided|2-Sided,,,,,0.47|0.95,,,Chi-squared|Chi-squared,,32|32|32|32|32|32|32|32,Participants|Participants,"ATX doses were split twice daily to prevent side effects.

The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of an investigational drug, AZD7325, as a potential treatment for high-functioning adults 18 -35 years old with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The primary study measures are effects on brain waves as measured by non-invasive brain wave recordings (electroencephalograms or EEGs), assessments of side effects, and measures of attention and learning.||The study drug, AZD7325, is manufactured by Astra Zeneca, and was initially tested as a medication for anxiety disorders in over 488 subjects, but was not pursued for marketing due to too few benefits for anxiety. AZD7325 was found to have a very good safety profile and was tolerated by the majority of subjects. AZD7325 has some similar actions to currently marketed anxiety drugs in the benzodiazepine class, but lacks the sedative and negative effects on attention of the benzodiazepines. The study drug is designed to target the GABA neurotransmitter system which is believed to be abnormal in this population.||There are 2 study phases. Phase 1 includes the recruitment of 24 healthy volunteers without mental disorder (6 per site) in order to establish normal EEG reference ranges. Controls will only be seen for one study visit which includes a clinical evaluation, physical exam, routine blood tests, and an EEG. Once control recruitment is complete, Phase 2 will begin.||Phase 2 involves the recruitment of 40 adults (10 per site) 18 - 35 years old with a diagnosis of ASD, normal intelligence, and specific EEG patterns compared to control values. Screening for eligibility will be performed in one visit, which includes a clinical evaluation, tests of learning and intelligence, blood and urine tests, and an EEG. Those subjects who are found to be eligible will be enrolled in a 6-week medication study. Subjects with ASD who are enrolled will be randomly assigned to receive the study drug AZD7325 or placebo in matching capsules. Subjects will be seen weekly by study physicians and clincians for the 7 study visits, including 3 additional EEG recordings, and then for a final follow-up visit (9 total visits including screening lasting up to 11 weeks to complete).

Considering total clinical experience, a patient is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline mentally ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill.|The CGI is a clinician-rated scale utilizing history from the caregiver and incorporating it into a clinical rating, first for severity, and then for clinical follow-up. The CGI-S will be used at the baseline assessment to judge symptom severity as 1 = Normal, not at all ill; 2 = Borderline ill; 3 = Mildly ill; 4 = Moderately ill; 5 = Markedly ill; 6 = Severely ill; and 7 = Among the most extremely ill. The CGI-I will be used at the Week 8 and End of Treatment/Week 16 visits to judge the change in clinical impression as 1 = Very Much Improved; 2 = Much Improved; 3 = Minimally Improved; 4 = No Change; 5 = Minimally Worse; 6 = Much Worse; and 7 = Very Much Worse.|The VAS will be used to measure the severity of three specific behavioral symptoms targeted in this study: behavior problems, language abilities, and eating behavior. For each behavior the caregiver is instructed to mark their impression of the behavior at the baseline visit and again at the Week 8 and End of Treatment/Week 16 visits. The calculated distance in cm between the visit marks thereby demonstrates whether each behavior stayed the same, improved, or worsened during the study and by how much. The scale is from 0 cm (defined as ""worst behavior"") to 10 cm (""behavior not a problem"").|The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) is a 58-item rating scale used to assess maladaptive behaviors across five original subscales: Irritability (15 items from 0-45), Social Withdrawal (16 items from 0-48), Stereotypy (7 items from 0-21), Hyperactivity (16 items from 0-48), Inappropriate Speech (4 items from 0-12). Additionally, Social Avoidance, a newly developed four-item subscale (from 0-12) of the ABC that captures core social avoidance aspects of Fragile X Syndrome is reported. All items on the ABC are rated from 0 (not at all a problem) to 3 (the problem is severe in degree). Higher scores indicate greater maladaptive behaviors.

The scale is composed of 5 factors which address: Manic/Hyperactive Behavior, Depressed Mood, Social Avoidance, General Anxiety and Obsessive/Compulsive Behavior.|The VABS-III is a caregiver survey interview that measures the personal and social skills of individuals from birth through adulthood. It was designed to assess handicapped and non-handicapped persons in their personal and social functioning and is appropriate for individuals of all ages. The Adaptive Behavior Composite (ABC) score is calculated from the caregiver responses using age-adjusted scoring tables. ABC scores range from 20 to 160 and indicate low (20-70), moderately low (70-85), adequate (85-115), moderately high (115-130), or high (130-160) overall adaptive functioning.|An EEG (electroencephalogram) maps timing of a subject's responses to sounds heard in a headset.|Subjects will view pictures shown on the screen.

Individuals with ASD often have behavioral issues and psychiatric comorbidities which can be very hard to manage. Currently, there are only two FDA approved medications (aripiprazole and risperidone) for the treatment of irritability in ASD. Both medications have the potential for side effects and are not tolerated in all children with ASD. Anecdotal and some preliminary studies suggest that cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid in the marijuana plant, may lead to improvements in symptoms of ASD including irritability, aggressive behaviors, and anxiety.||In this study the investigators will test whether CBD leads to differences in behaviors commonly associated with ASD. The main behavioral problems investigators will study are irritability and aggressive behavior. This study will also measure changes in other behaviors seen in ASD such as anxiety, social interaction difficulties, repetitive behaviors, attentional problems, hyperactivity, repetitive behaviors, and quality of life.

Cannabidivarin (CBDV) is a nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid and a safe variant of Cannabidiol (CBD). It has no appreciable tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) [less than 0.01%], has been shown to have no impact on weight or metabolism, and improves both social and cognitive functioning in animal models of idiopathic and syndromal autism (Fragile X, Rett Syndrome, Angelman Syndrome). The CDC currently estimates 1 in 59 children have ASD. ASD is characterized by deficits in social communication, irritability, repetitive behaviors, impulsivity, temper tantrums, and high caregiver burden. Currently, the only FDA-approved medications for symptoms of ASD are aripiprazole and risperidone, both of which are indicated for irritability in pediatric ASD. These medications are effective but are associated with considerable side effects with long term treatment in this chronic developmental disorder, including weight gain, metabolic syndrome and the risk of type 2 diabetes, prolactin elevation and growth of breast tissue, extrapyramidal symptoms and the risk of tardive dyskinesia. The anticonvulsant divalproex sodium (valproate/VPA) also significantly reduces irritability and repetitive behaviors in individuals with ASD. Although VPA is efficacious for pediatric epilepsy and some symptoms of ASD, it also has significant side effects, including weight gain, sedation and nausea. CBDV, like VPA, is effective in the treatment of pediatric epilepsy, and ASD mouse models demonstrate potential mechanisms for treatment with CBDV, including potential therapeutic effects on repetitive behaviors, irritability, sociability, and quality of life, and the capacity to reduce inflammation. This study aims to examine the efficacy and safety of cannabidivarin (CBDV) with a primary aim of studying its effect on irritability in children with ASD.||STUDY DESIGN: This is a 12-week randomized, double-blind study of CBDV vs. placebo in 100 child and adolescent subjects aged 5 to 18 years with a diagnosis of ASD.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria||Male or Female pediatric outpatients aged between and including ages 5 to 18.

Current treatment is based on behavioral interventions combined with atypical antipsychotics which often have low tolerability and questionable efficacy.||Cannabis exerts profound effects on human social behavior. Research using animal models of ASD indicate a possible dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system, and stress that it may be a novel target for pharmacological interventions. Anecdotal evidence suggest efficacy of various phytocannabinoids in resistant behavioral problems.

Such perceptual optimization reflects the shifting excitatory and inhibitory actions of individual neurons.

Subsequently, there is gradual stabilization of severe mental retardation and motor compromise (stage 3). The majority (70% to 80%) of patients demonstrate mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding-protein-2 (MeCP2) gene, a transcription repressor located on chromosome Xq28. The disorder predominantly affects females, but a few males with mutations in MeCP2 have been identified, even though many of them do not have the classic symptoms recognized in females.||Recent studies demonstrate increased brain N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in stages 2 and 3 of the disease.

Participants will be randomized to receive one of three doses of dextromethorphan. All participants will be admitted to the hospital for three days at the beginning of the study. During the hospitalization, participants will undergo physical exam, Dexascan, MRI, EEG, behavioral assessment, laboratory testing, and neuropsychological evaluations.

Treatment of epilepsy is always indicated, but treatment of isolated epileptiform EEG (i.e. in the absence of clinical seizures) is frankly controversial.

In EEG studies, electric patterns that resemble epileptic seizures are known as epileptiform pattern. These patterns are associated with an increased risk of seizures, even in people who have not been diagnosed with epilepsy. Epileptiform patterns also appear on the EEGs of some children who have autism spectrum disorders but do not have epilepsy. It is unclear if these discharges are related in any way to the symptoms of autism (behavior, language or intellectual abilities).|Divalproex sodium (Depakote) is a drug that has been used for many years to treat epilepsy and other brain disorders in children and adults. Researchers are interested determining whether treatment with divalproex sodium can reduce epileptiform patterns in children with autism spectrum disorders, and in doing so study whether this treatment can improve behavior, language or cognition in children with autism spectrum disorders.||Objectives:||- To study the effectiveness of using divalproex sodium to reduce epileptiform EEG discharges in children with autism spectrum disorders.||Eligibility:||- Children between 3 and 10 years of age who have an autism spectrum disorder and show frequent epileptiform discharges on an overnight EEG.||Design:||This study will last for a total of 9 months, with 6 months of treatment with either divalproex sodium or a placebo followed by 3 months of treatment with divalproex sodium only.|Potential participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, blood samples, and psychological tests, and will spend the night in the NIH Clinical Center to have an overnight EEG.

ASDs are neurodevelopmental disorders that result in abnormalities of social and language development and are associated with rigid and repetitive behaviors. ASD prevalence may be as common as 1 in 110 and as many as 1/3 of these individuals have seizures. Abnormal electroencephalograms (EEGs) (without seizure activity) are even more prevalent (Spence & Schneider, 2009). In an ongoing study at the NIMH, approximately 50% of children without epilepsy had epileptiform discharges present on overnight EEG. The relationship between this abnormal activity and autism symptoms has not yet been studied; however, data from other epilepsy syndromes suggest that these epileptiform discharges contribute to behavioral and cognitive deficits. It is also unknown whether or not reduction of the epileptiform discharges will result in improved behavior and more rapid intellectual and social development in children with ASD. This pilot study is designed to address that question.||Study Population||100 children with ASDs including Autistic Disorder, Asperger's or PDD-NOS ages 3-10 will be screened to find up to 40 children with frequent epileptiform discharges noted on overnight EEG. Allowing for up to 20% drop out, we expect at least 32 to complete the study.||Design||The proposed investigation is a 9 month long trial with a 6 month double-blind placebo controlled trial of divalproex sodium (Depakote) and a 3 month open label extension phase. Prior to study entry, potential subjects will be evaluated with the standard PDN diagnostic/behavioral assessment (06-M-0065). Children meeting eligibility criteria will undergo an overnight EEG and those with frequent epileptiform discharges will be randomly assigned to receive divalproex sodium or placebo. Study drugs will be administered in a blinded fashion for 24 weeks with overnight EEG at 12 and 24 weeks. Biweekly then monthly visits with laboratory studies will monitor for behavioral improvement and for potential adverse effects. A 3 month open label extension phase follows.||Outcome Measures||The primary outcome measure will be EEG changes; tolerability and changes in behavioral symptoms will be exploratory secondary outcome assessments. It is hypothesized that divalproex will be superior to placebo in reducing epileptiform discharges on the EEG. In addition, exploratory analyses will investigate whether children who demonstrate improvements and even normalization of the EEG pattern will have more associated behavioral improvements than those for whom the EEG does not improve.",,,,,"INCLUSION CRITERIA:||Have a diagnosis of Autistic Disorder, Asperger's syndrome, or Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS).|Are aged 3 to 10 years.|Weigh at least 12.5 kg.|Only children with frequent epileptiform EEG activity on the overnight EEG at NIH will be randomized to start study drug.

152,NCT00376194,,,,DMSA,,,,,,,,,,,"This study will examine whether DMSA, an oral chelating agent that removes mercury and other metals from the body, is beneficial for children with autism. DMSA is commonly used to treat autism, although it has never been tested in a controlled study and there is no proof that it helps children with the disorder. Support for its use is based on single-case reports of benefits of chelation with DMSA. This study will help determine whether or not DMSA is useful for treating autism.||Children between 4 and 10 years of age with autism spectrum disorder who weigh at least 33 pounds, who have detectable, but not toxic, levels of mercury or lead in the blood, and who have not previously received chelation therapy may be eligible for this study.||Participants complete a medical history, behavioral and psychological assessment and physical examination. Blood, hair, urine and stool samples are collected for testing.||Because DMSA can remove minerals the body needs, such as zinc and iron, as well as the toxic lead and mercury, participants take a daily multivitamin supplement starting 1 month before beginning chelation therapy and continuing for the duration of treatment. After 1 month of the supplementation regimen, the children are assigned to receive DMSA or placebo for 12 weeks, divided into six 2-week cycles. They take the assigned drug 3 times a day on days 1, 2 and 3 of each cycle and continue the multivitamin every day.||The children are seen in the clinic immediately before and after the first, third and sixth cycles.

This widespread use reflects the hypothesis that many cases of ASD are caused by exposure to thimerosal, an ethylmercury-based compound used previously in the US as a vaccine preservative for routine childhood immunizations. The prevalent use of chelation therapy stands in stark contrast with the lack of scientific or clinical evidence of efficacy, and creates a public health imperative for empiric data. Thus we propose a controlled trial of the effects of chelation on the core behavioral symptoms and overall functioning of children with ASD. The present investigation is a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study of the oral chelating agent meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA; succimer) among 120 children, ages four to ten years, who meet criteria for ASD. Pre- and post-treatment behavioral ratings will be used to evaluate the efficacy of chelation. In addition, children will undergo comprehensive medical history, physical examination and laboratory analyses.||Our objective is to quantify differences in behavioral functioning between the chelation treatment group and the placebo control group. Analysis of mercury levels before and during the course of treatment will be used to confirm the expected DMSA-induced excretion of mercury and to identify differences among children in the extent of excretion.

Though recent research has revealed much about the genetic and neurobiological bases of FraX, knowledge about specific and effective treatments for affected individuals is lacking. Based on information from both human and animal studies, one cause of intellectual disability in FraX may be related to deficits in a particular brain neurotransmitter system (the ""cholinergic"" system). Thus, the investigators propose to use a specific medication, donepezil, to augment cholinergic system in adolescents affected by FraX.

Though research progress pertaining to FraX has been extraordinary in many areas, many critical gaps in knowledge remain. In particular, there is a dearth of information on treatments designed to address the often-serious cognitive and behavioral symptoms of FraX. Like many other developmental disorders, descriptions of treatments for FraX that do exist in the literature are primarily derived from uncontrolled case studies or series, with both pharmacological and behavioral interventions targeted to symptoms associated with phenomenologically defined ""co-morbid"" diagnoses such as AD/HD, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or anxiety disorders. These circumstances are suboptimal as such symptom-based treatments represent a low level of specificity with respect to the underlying pathogenesis of cognitive and behavioral problems. Accordingly, new research to develop more effective, disease-specific treatments for persons with FraX is greatly needed.||Converging evidence from our research group and others strongly support a hypothesis of functional cholinergic deficits contributing to cognitive-behavioral dysfunction in FraX. This evidence includes: (1) abnormalities of cholinergic pathway function and neurochemistry observed with functional MRI and 1H-MRS, respectively, in FraX, (2) an analysis of FMR1 expression during human fetal development indicating particularly high expression in cholinergic brain regions, (3) cholinergic system abnormalities detected in the mouse and fly models of FraX, (4) an analysis of the specific profile of cognitive and behavioral deficits in FraX in relation to current knowledge of cholinergic system functions, and, (5) significant improvements in cognition and behavior observed in 12 individuals with FraX during an open-label trial of donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor. Accordingly, the proposed project will consist of a double blind, placebo controlled trial of donepezil in 50 individuals with FraX, ages 12 to 29 years. The primary hypothesis is that subjects receiving donepezil will show greater improvements in specific measures of behavior and cognition, relative to the placebo group. In addition to direct benefit to persons affected by FraX, findings from the proposed research are likely to be highly relevant to subgroups of (currently) idiopathic developmental disorders, such as autism, that might share common pathophysiological mechanisms of disease with FraX. Such shared mechanisms could occur through intersecting pathways involving FMR1 protein function or as a result of similarities in the contribution of cholinergic dysfunction to cognitive and behavioral disability.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||confirmed genetic diagnosis of fragile X syndrome|age >=12, <=29|Verbal IQ >= 50, <=75|Tanner pubertal stage >= 3||Exclusion Criteria:||Current or lifetime DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychotic disorder, NOS based upon reported history|Poorly controlled seizure disorder or taking more than one anticonvulsant (subjects cannot be prescribed carbamazepine, phenytoin, or phenobarbital due to potential interaction effects with donepezil).

Additionally, we will enroll 16 children with an ASD who do not meet criteria for relative REM deficiency in an open label arm to ascertain whether or not donepezil is beneficial to behavior in this group.||iii. Design||The proposal is for a 6 month treatment trial of 2.5 mg donepezil/placebo/day followed by 12 months of longitudinal follow-up. The primary study endpoint will be an examination of autism core symptoms and sleep architecture after 12 months.||iv. Outcome measures||The primary outcome measure will be:||An improvement in the Expressive Language and the Receptive Language subscales of the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) at 12 months.||Secondary outcome measures will be:||We will also measure the change in REM sleep parameters after 6, 12 and 18 months in relation to improvements in behavioral indices.||Exploratory Outcome Measures will be:||An improvement in the Expressive Language and the Receptive Language subscales of the Mullen Scales at 18 months.|An improvement on the severity scale of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) at 6, 12 and 18 months.|An improvement on the Vineland at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months|An exploratory analysis will investigate whether normalization of REM parameters also improves other measurements of sleep quality in children with autism.",,,,,"INCLUSION CRITERIA:||Diagnosis of an Autism Spectrum Disorder (DSM-IV diagnoses of autistic disorder or Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified).|Male or Female subjects between the ages of 24 and 50 months.|Language scores (from the Mullen Scales of Early Learning) that are at least 1.5 SD lower than the mean.||5.

ASD has become increasingly prevalent during the last few decades (Wiznitzer, 2005).||The neuro-anatomical substrate of ASD has been the subject of intense investigation, but current findings are inconclusive, limited and sometimes even contradictory.||Medical treatment of autism is still a matter of dispute.

The mean slope of regression lines for FEV1 and FVC, plus change DLCO, shuttle walk distance and QoL in the doxycycline and placebo groups will be compared by parametric or non-parametric analysis dependent on data, time to composite safety endpoint by Caplan-Meier analysis, complications and adverse events by Chi Square test.||1. Introduction||Lymphangioleiomyomatosis Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a disease of the lungs and lymphatics, which can occur sporadically or in association with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). The disease is rare, occurring in 1-2 / million of the population but in up to 40% of women with TSC LAM almost exclusively affects women, generally developing before the menopause. The disease is characterised by progressive pulmonary cystic change, recurrent pneumothorax, chylous pleural collections and, in most cases, progressive respiratory failure. Abdominal manifestations caused by obstruction and dilation of the axial lymphatics include lymphadenopathy, cystic lymphatic masses (lymphangioleiomyomas), chylous ascites and angiomyolipoma (a benign tumour). Survival in LAM is, 70 90% at 10 yrs, although this is highly variable since long-term survivors have been described. Diagnosis is made by a combination of clinical features and computed tomography scanning or, in cases of doubt, lung biopsy. In patients with rapidly progressive disease, hormone treatment (predominantly progesterone) has been used, although no firm evidence supports its use. Otherwise, treatment is aimed at complications including pneumothorax, chylous collections and extra-pulmonary manifestations. The only treatment for severe LAM is currently lung transplantation(Johnson 2006). Recently identification of abnormalities in the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) genes in sporadic and TSC associated LAM have identified dysregulation of the mTOR pathway in LAM (Carsillo, Astrinidis et al. 2000; Sato, Seyama et al. 2002) and have lead to clinical trials of mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin in LAM and TSC. At the time of writing these have not been reported but appear promising.||Background and preliminary data Cystic lung destruction is the hallmark of pulmonary LAM and generally results in respiratory failure over a variable period of time(Johnson 2006). Over-activity of proteases including elastase, trypsin and the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is responsible for parenchymal destruction in emphysema and other lung diseases. The MMPs are a family of zinc dependent proteolytic enzymes with proteolytic activities against extra-cellular matrix proteins. The MMPs are overexpressed in inflammatory and neoplastic diseases where in addition to processing extra-cellular matrix they also have roles in metastasis, angiogenesis, growth factor activation and inactivation(Stamenkovic 2003). MMPs -1, -2, and -9 are involved in the sequential digestion of collagen and gelatin and are strongly expressed in the walls of cysts where it is thought they contribute to parenchymal destruction in LAM(Matsui, Takeda et al. 2000). Further, MMPs can be detected by gelatin zymography in the urine of patients with LAM but not controls. Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic in common clinical use. In addition to its antimicrobial action it inhibits the synthesis and activity of several MMPs and inhibits proliferation of a range of cell types including arterial smooth muscle, cancer cells and cancer model systems(Bendeck, Conte et al. 2002; Duivenvoorden, Popovic et al. 2002; Onoda, Ono et al. 2004). In preliminary experiments we have demonstrated that primary LAM derived and angiomyolipoma cells produce MMP-2 and -7 and that MMP expression and proliferation in these cells in inhibited by doxycycline.||Preliminary clinical data of doxycycline in LAM In a preliminary open label study of doxycycline (50 - 100 mg qds) in 10 patients with LAM, doxycycline improved 6 minute walk distance) and Borg dyspnoea score (Glassberg et al. Data presented at the LAM Foundation International Research Conference, Cincinnati Ohio 2006). In a single case report, Moses et al. observed an improvement in FEV1 and oxygenation during exercise in a patient with LAM treated with 100mg doxycycline daily (Moses, Harper et al. 2006). In both of these cases MMP-2 and -9 were initially present in the patient's urine and was undetectable after treatment with doxycycline. In a study of 14 patients, doxycycline 100mg bd is known to give a mean plasma concentration of 4.41 µg/ml (range 1.9-9.4 µg/ml)(Prall, Longo et al. 2002).||Specific issues in orphan disease clinical trials and rationale for trial design Studying orphan diseases presents specific challenges, specifically the limited number of patients available, wide geographic distribution and low priority for funding due to the perceived poor economic benefit. Patients are well informed about potential developments due to patient groups and internet based information(Tattersfield and Glassberg 2006) and may obtain potential treatments 'off label' making definitive research studies impossible. As LAM is rare, cohorts drawn from a wide area are required for studies to achieve adequate power. We have 15 years experience of LAM research and from our UK LAM database estimate there are approximately 120 patients in the UK. We are currently performing an open label study of Sirolimus in LAM and tuberous sclerosis (TESSTAL, a Study of The Efficacy and Safety of Sirolimus (Rapamycin) Therapy for Renal Angiomyolipomas in Patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex And Sporadic Lymhangioleiomyomatosis). This included six patients with LAM whom we found to be well motivated and will travel long distances for study visits (including Cornwall, Kent and Perth). Despite the known adverse effects of rapamycin six of eight eligible (i.e. with LAM and angiomyolipoma) patients invited took part in the study. The current study protocol has been designed as a simple protocol which is both inclusive of most patients with LAM and has a follow up which is similar to routine clinical care which we hope will facilitate recruitment. In addition the protocol is less demanding than that of the TESSTAL study. As most patients are known to us via our database or clinical contacts we expect recruitment to be complete within six months.||Designing a definitive study is difficult without having an estimate of the likely size of effect, if this is large, as suggested by the one case report(Moses, Harper et al. 2006) a small number of patients are needed. If it is small as seems more likely a priori, a larger number of patients are needed requiring European collaboration and considerably greater funding. We therefore designed a pragmatic pilot study using a single geographic population with a simple, inexpensive protocol which will serve several functions, specifically to: (1) determine the optimum dose of doxycycline needed to suppress MMP production. (2) define the safety profile of doxycycline in LAM. (3) provide evidence of efficacy and size of effect. (4) provide data to help optimise the design and logistics of future trials.||2 Study aims/objectives||Hypothesis Doxycycline will prevent matrix metalloproteinase dependent tissue destruction in lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) thus preserving lung function, exercise capacity and quality of life.||We will perform a randomised placebo controlled trial of doxycycline on rate of decline of FEV1 over two years against matched placebo. This study will:||determine the optimum dose of doxycycline needed to suppress MMP production.|define the safety profile of doxycycline in LAM.|provide evidence for efficacy and size of effect.|provide data to help optimise the design and logistics of future trials.||With the data obtained we will be in a strong position to apply for European funding for a European wide trial should this still be required.||3 Investigational plan||Patient population and recruitment||Forty patients with either sporadic LAM or TSC-LAM will be recruited from the UK LAM database, physician referrals, LAM Action (a patients group for women with LAM) and the Tuberous Sclerosis Association. Patients will be contacted by mail by the principal investigator. Potential participants will receive a preliminary information sheet and response sheet for return by prepaid post. Those that express a potential interest in participating will be offered a face to face interview with one of the study doctors to assess eligibility, answer questions, obtain details of all physicians involved in their care and obtain written consent prior to enrolment.

Cannabidiol (CBD), a compound originally derived from the cannabis plant but without the psychoactive effects found in cannabis, has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of children with severe epilepsy. Two non-controlled studies using CBD from local sources have demonstrated improvements in behavior in children with autism. Parents of autistic children have been using CBD products in an unregulated fashion with unknown dosing with anecdotal reports of improved behavior. This study will use EPIDIOLEX (EPX), a purified CBD oral solution that was FDA approved in June 2018 to treat severe forms of pediatric epilepsy. Study subjects will be 30 boys between 7 and 14 years of age with autism who have severe behavior problems. Every child will undergo baseline clinical evaluation, neuropsychological, behavioral, cognitive, and language testing, will have a test of brain wave activity (EEG) and a brain MRI scan. parents will complete questionnaires on various aspects of their child's behavior. Fifteen children will receive CBD for 8 weeks and 15 will receive a placebo that looks and tastes similar to the CBD (Period 1). All of the baseline tests and questionnaires will then be repeated. After a 4 week washout period, behavioral and cognitive tests and questionnaires will be repeated and then the treatments will be reversed (Period 2). At the end of 8 weeks, all of the baseline tests and questionnaires will be repeated. Study personnel and parents will be blinded to the treatment status of each child. Statistical analyses will be used to determine whether there are significant differences between baseline testing and results after placebo or CBD treatment. Types and severities of adverse events will be tracked to provide information about the safety and tolerability of CBD in this population. If CBD is found to be safe and effective in treating the behavioral problems associated with autism, this would be a major new tool in the treatment of those children that could lead to improved functioning and quality of life for the affected individuals and their families.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Boys ages 7-14 years|Confirmed diagnosis of autism based on ADOS testing|Autism severity assessed as severe with substantial behavioral problems||Severity of symptoms will be based on a number of criteria:||Aggressive and/or self-injurious (SIBs) behaviors occur almost daily (more than 6 times per week) in any situation (home, school, clinic, etc.).|Frequent (daily), persistent (lasting at least 5-10 minutes and repeated through the day) stereotypies (repetitive behaviors such as hand flapping, running in circles, jumping repeatedly, waving fingers in front of eyes)|Pervasive hyperactivity (child is so physically active that he cannot sit for meals or school work, is moving all the time, jumping off furniture, climbing onto furniture, etc.)|One of more of the above activities is deemed to contribute significantly to child's inability to function by parental report and with clinician agreement based on history and/or direct observation||Exclusion Criteria:||the presence of epilepsy|a known genetic condition such as tuberous sclerosis|other significant health issues such as cardiac disease, presence of known congenital brain malformation, or a history of central nervous system infection.|children who are on anticonvulsant medications such as clobazam or valproic acid will also be excluded because of potential drug-drug interactions.

Duration of SEGA response was evaluated only for participants who achieved a SEGA response. The time to SEGA progression was censored if SEGA progression was not observed before the first to occur out of (i) analysis cut-off date (ii) the date when systemic anti-SEGA medication is started, (iii) the date of a SEGA-related surgery or (iv) the date of death. Since, no case of SEGA progression was observed in core study which resulted in censored duration of SEGA response. Only 5 SEGA responders experienced a SEGA progression in extension period.|Time to SEGA worsening was defined as the time from the start of everolimus to date of the first SEGA worsening. SEGA worsening was defined as either; increase from nadir of ≥ 25% in SEGA volume or unequivocal worsening of non-target SEGA lesions, or appearance of new SEGA lesion ≥ 1.0 cm in longest diameter, or new or worsening hydrocephalus. The median value was not reached in either treatment arm of core period as SEGA worsening was observed in less participants (everolimus - 7 and placebo - 8).|Skin lesions included hypomelanotic macules, the shagreen patch, periungual or subungual fibromas, facial angiofibromas and/or forehead plaques. Response was evaluated using the Physician's Global Assessment of Clinical Condition (PGA) on a 7-point scale: Grade 0 = complete clinical response, indicated absence of disease, Grade 1, 2, and 3 = partial response, indicated improvements of ≥ 50% but < 100%, Grade 4, 5 = stable disease, indicated some or no improvements of 25% - < 50% and 6 = progressive disease, indicated worse than at baseline evaluation by > 25%. Response rate was determined for participants with ≥ 1 skin lesion at baseline, defined as the percentage of participants with overall status as complete clinical response or partial response.|Duration of skin lesion response was defined as the time from the first skin lesion response until the first skin lesion progression, defined as worsening of lesion by > 25% or more from baseline.|The participants were assessed for everolimus blood concentration at 2 hours time point after dose administration on the same day, if the participant did not vomit between previous dose and blood sample collection.

Children with ASD often have difficulty communicating symptoms or tolerating Polysomnography (Sleep Study). This makes establishing a diagnosis of RLS or PLMS very difficult in children with ASD. Because polysomnography is not well tolerated in children with ASD and cannot measure sleep over time in a natural environment, improvements in sleep with treatment with iron will be measured by standard actigraphy (a watch that measures movements during sleep) and sleep diaries. The investigators also propose to evaluate periodic limb movement index (PLMI) as a predictor of response to iron treatment for insomnia in children with ASD, as measured by the PAM-RL, an actigraph designed to measure PLMS. The investigators will collect secondary data regarding attention and behavior over the course of the study to monitor improvement in daytime functioning in both groups. Many clinicians will empirically treat children with ASD, insomnia and low ferritin levels (< 50ng/ml) with iron. This is based on data from a previous open label trial demonstrating subjective improvement in restless sleep in children with ASD with low/low normal ferritin levels who were treated with iron. In order to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment, The investigators propose a randomized placebo-controlled trial of oral elemental iron for treatment of insomnia in children with ASD and ferritin levels that are low but above the laboratory cut off for deficiency.

The population prevalence of autism is approximately 1 in 1000 (GILLBERG and WING, 1999) and the ratio of affected males to females is 4:1 (FOMBONNE, 1999). Although typically considered a childhood disorder, most persons with autism experience marked functional impairment throughout their lives. Follow-up studies of children with autism show that only 5%-10% become independent as adults, 25% progress but still require supervision, and the remaining continue to be severely impaired and in need of institutionalized care (WING, 1989). Thus, the syndrome represents a substantial public health problem with tragic cost to the individual, the family, and the community.||It is a randomized, double blind flexible dose study with parallel groups, controlled, fluoxetine versus placebo.||The final efficacy evaluation will be done after 6 months of treatment; Nine obligatory visits are planned Patients will be assessed at the following visits: base-line inclusion (D-15), and 2, 4, ,12, ,20, 22, 24 25, 26 weeks. At the 24 W visit, the final efficacy will be performed and medication will be tapered over a maximum period of 2 weeks. The final safety assessment will be performed at 26W.||BRAIN IMAGING PROTOCOL :||We will assess the resting state regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in autistic children using labeled water and PET, as it is still the most reliable and least invasive method. In addition, an anatomical and functional MRI will be performed in all children, the same day. Brain imaging studies will be performed at the Service HOSPITALIER Frederic JOLIOT (ORSAY, France) under Dr Monica ZILBOVICIUS responsibility.||Each brain imaging examination will be performed twice: 1) at time zero (T0) - before the beginning of the treatment and 2) six month later, after placebo or sertraline treatment.||Functional imaging in the resting state - Positron emission tomography :||Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) will be measured on a Siemens ECAT HR+ camera. Attenuation-corrected data are reconstructed into 63 slices, with a resulting resolution of 4.5 mm full-width-at-half-maximum. Fifteen seconds before each scan, 7 mCi of H215O is administrated by bolus injection. Data are collected during 80 s. All rCBF examinations will be performed at rest during sleep induced by premedication (4 mg/kg of pentobarbital). We have previously reported that this premedication has no effects on absolute rCBF values and regional distribution.||Anatomical MRI:||A high resolution MRI of the brain will be obtained in all children witg a 1.5 Tesla Signa General Electric scanner using a 3D T1-weighted FSPGR sequence (TR/TE/TI/NEX: 10.5/2.2/600/1, flip angle 10°, matrix size 256 x 192, yielding 124 axial slices and a thickness of 1.2 mm, field of view 22 cm). The acquisition duration is 6 minutes. In addition, FLAIR and T2 axial and coronal sequences will be also acquired.||Biological measures:||Blood sample procedure for whole blood serotonin: patients must follow a diet poor in tryptophan during two days before the blood sampling. Blood sample will be performed without premedication between nine and 11 AM. Blood will be withdrawn into tubes containing EDTA acid and aprotinin. Platelet- poor plasma (containing up to 0.1% of the original platelet count as assessed by contrast phase microscopy) is obtained within 2 hours by centrifugation (2000g, 4C, 15 mn) and frozen as 0.5mL aliquots at -80C until assess (blind procedures will be used).

Approximately 10 Canadian children per 10 000 live births suffer from the disorder, which is three to four times more common in males than in females. It is characterized by social and and communicative deficits and restricted, repetitive interests and behaviours. Most autistic children are delayed in the acquisition of both verbal and non-verbal communication skills and many never develop useful language. Three-quarters of autistic children have mild to severe mental retardation and a quarter develop seizures during later childhood or adolescence. Its etiology is heterogenous and there is no cure. Although behaviour therapy is an important tool in management, pharmacotherapy remains a necessity for many children. Current therapy is limited to antipsychotic drugs that can carry an unacceptable risk of chronic neurotoxicity (tardive dyskinesia) or tricyclic antidepressants that have undesireble cardiovascular effects. This study proposes to evaluate the potential benefit of selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in autism.||All autistic children whose symptoms are not currently well controlled will be offered entry into the trial.

The Centers for Disease Control estimates that ASD affects as many as 14.7 per 1000 children (1 in 68). Despite the dramatic rise in the detected prevalence of ASD over the past two decades, no effective medical treatment has been developed to address core ASD symptoms (social communication and repetitive behavior), the closely associated problem of language impairment, or the underlying pathophysiology of ASD. Currently, the only accepted treatment for core ASD symptoms is behavior therapy, which may entail intensive one-on-one treatment over several years.||The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of folinic acid in the treatment of language problems in children with autism spectrum disorder. Folinic acid, also known as leucovorin, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to decrease side effects during cancer chemotherapy. Folinic acid may be helpful in treating language problems in children with autism spectrum disorder, but this is not known. Therefore, folinic acid is an investigational new drug for this study.||The primary aims of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of high-dose folinic acid for improving the closely associated symptoms of language impairment in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Improvement in delayed language may also benefit the core ASD problem of social communication. The study will also focus on identification of biomarkers in pre-specified subgroups of children with ASD that may moderate positive response to folinic acid. The study model is that high-dose folinic acid will improve language and set the stage for improved social communication in children with ASD and moderate language impairment. To test whether folinic acid is superior to placebo, 134 children (age 5 to 12 yrs 6 months, inclusive) with ASD and moderate language will be randomly assigned to folinic acid or placebo for 12 weeks under double-blind conditions. The study team will also test whether abnormalities in folate-dependent pathways, such as dysfunctional transport of folate across the blood-brain barrier, will moderate positive response to folinic acid treatment.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Boys and girls ≥ 5 years and < 12 years 5 months of age;|Weight ≥ 15 kg;|DSM-5 diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder as established by clinical assessment, corroborated by the Social Communication Questionnaire and the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule.|A score < 80 on the Core Language score of the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals -4 (CELF)- 4 or the Second Edition of the CELF-Preschool test (CELF-P).|Current Clinical Global Impression Severity score ≥ 4 on ASD + communication delay.|IQ at least 40 as measured by the Leiter-3 or mental age at least 18 months as measured on the Receptive Language Scale of the Mullen.|Stable educational plan (one month) with no planned changes in the intensity of treatment for 12 weeks.

Currently, there is no FDA approved medical therapy that addresses either core ASD symptoms or pathophysiological processes associated with ASD. For example, the two FDA approved antipsychotic medications for treating ASD are indicated for symptoms associated with ASD, not core ASD symptoms. Based on strong preliminary evidence, this study aims to improve core ASD symptoms with folinic acid. Two biological mechanisms for response to the intervention are proposed and investigated in this study.||Folate is an essential B vitamin required for normal neurodevelopment. Folinic acid is a reduced form of folate that has been shown to improve both the metabolic and core symptoms associated with ASD in an open-label study and large case-series. This study will extend this preliminary evidence to demonstrate clinical efficacy of folinic acid in a double-blind placebo-controlled manner while also evaluating the biological mechanisms associated with the clinical response.||Preliminary evidence for the efficacy of folinic acid is two-fold: First, several independent studies have demonstrated that a folinic acid intervention improves ASD core symptoms in ASD patients diagnosed with cerebral folate deficiency - a metabolic disorder in which the primary pathway for the transport of folate across the blood-brain barrier is dysfunctional. The primary transport pathway for folate across the blood-brain barrier uses the folate receptor α (FRα) and energy dependent endocytosis. A secondary pathway, the reduced folate carrier (RFC), can transport reduced forms of folate, such as folinic acid, across the blood-brain barrier. In case-series of children with ASD and cerebral folate deficiency, folinic acid (0.5 to 2 mg/kg/day) improved communication, social interaction, attention, and stereotypical behavior in some (3-6) and completely ameliorated ASD symptoms in others (6, 7).||The major cause of cerebral folate deficiency is an autoantibody that binds to the FRα and interferes with its ability to bind and transport folate. Recently, Frye et al. found that (a) autoantibodies to the FRα were present in approximately 75% of children with ASD, and (b) an intervention with folinic acid (2mg/kg/day; max 50mg) in children with ASD and FRα autoantibodies resulted in significant improvements in parental ratings of receptive and expressive language, verbal communication, stereotypic behavior, and attention as compared to parental rating for children that did not undergo any intervention (wait group) over a similar time period. This proposal will extend these preliminary findings by documenting response to a folinic acid intervention in a double-blind placebo-controlled manner and test whether FRα autoantibody titers predict response to a folinic acid intervention. If FRα autoantibody titers are found to predict response to the intervention, such titers could provide a biomarker to identify a subset of children with ASD that may benefit from a folinic acid intervention and may even predict the development of ASD symptoms in high risk siblings during the presymptomatic period.||Second, the ratio of reduced-to-oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) is an established measure of systemic redox status and oxidative stress that has been shown in three independent case-control studies to be significantly decreased in many ASD children. James et al. have shown in a 3 month open-label clinical trial that an intervention of folinic acid and methyl-B12 significantly improved GSH/GSSG and Vineland scores for expressive language, receptive language, and socialization in ASD children. Important unanswered questions are (a) whether this preliminary data can be confirmed in a larger double-blind placebo-controlled study, (b) whether redox status before the folinic acid intervention can predict response to intervention and (c) whether improved systemic redox status is associated with improvement in core ASD symptoms.||This study will assess whether a folinic acid intervention can improve both core symptoms of ASD (i.e., communication, socialization, stereotyped movements) and associated comorbid symptoms (i.e., attention) in a double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial. This study will address whether improvements in core ASD symptoms associated with the intervention are related to biomarkers of either (or both) biological mechanisms proposed to be influenced by the intervention (i.e., GSH/GSSG, FRα autoantibody titer). Thus, using these biomarkers, it may be possible that children with ASD who optimally respond to the folinic acid intervention can be readily identified early after diagnosis or even during the pre-symptomatic period.||This double blind, placebo-controlled (DBPC) study will evaluate the efficacy of Folinic Acid for the treatment of language impaired autism spectrum disorder patients aged 3-14 years. The study will consist of a single site trial with approximatley 48 entering the DBPC phase. Subjects will be male or female with current or prospective diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Language Impairments will be defined by the CELF, or PLS when warranted.||Phase 1 will consist of approximately 57children aged 3-14 with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (as defined by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule or the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised), until approximately 48 children with confirmed ASD are enrolled into a randomized control trial (RCT; Phase 2). Enrollment will continue as needed until approximately 43 complete Phase 2. Approximately 40 will enroll into phase 3.||Initial analyses will be undertaken to inspect data for errors, inconsistencies, and incomplete information. This will include examining the data with simple frequency tables and dot plots for univariate data and scatter plots and multi-way dot plots with bivariate and multivariate data. To summarize bivariate relationships among predictors and between predictors and outcomes, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient will be used. For reporting inferential statistics, regression coefficients along with the 95 percent confidence intervals will be used extensively to quantify degree of clinical importance.||The primary population will be the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population and is defined as all subjects who have completed at least one post treatment primary outcome measure. A secondary analysis will be performed on the ""as treated"" population defined as those subjects who had at least 75% compliance of prescribed medications and have not significantly deviated from the protocol.||To determine whether the folinic acid intervention over a 12-week period improves core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder in Phase 2, the procedure Proc Mixed in SAS will be used to fit a mixed model analysis of covariance. For the multisite study, the full model with the response variable language assessment will include predictors such as: intervention, time, autoantibody, intervention by time interaction, autoantibody by intervention interaction, redox status, redox status by time interaction, and baseline covariates. However, for the single site study, the number of variables in the model will be limited due to the smaller sample size and separate models will be performed on subgroups to compare the effects of the treatment in various subgroups. The results from the mixed model will determine if the biomarkers of physiological abnormalities, both autoantibodies and redox status, predict intervention response. Similar analysis will be performed for the secondary outcomes.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria||1.

40,NCT05063656,,8-week treatment with gabapentin,Drug: Gabapentin,Gabapentin,,,,,,,,,Gabapentin Open-label treatment,Experimental,"The social cognitive deficits associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are related to an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, specifically a deficit in the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. The investigators have used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques to measure GABA in specific brain regions and have demonstrated that a single dose of gabapentin increases GABA in brain regions associated with social cognition. This study will use a biomarker-driven approach to investigate gabapentin to correct the underlying imbalance of neurotransmitters and improve the core social cognitive deficits in ASD. By using a brain-based biomarker (GABA) that is quantifiable and measurable, the investigators can target this biomarker directly and measure the impact of the treatment. This will help with the future development of targeted therapies for ASD and provide an early marker of response to aid in the selection of individuals more likely to respond to various treatments. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) determine if treatment with gabapentin sustainably increases GABA in the right anterior insula (RAI; an area of the brain involved in social cognition), 2) determine if response of RAI GABA levels to a single dose challenge of gabapentin predicts a sustained response after treatment, and 3) determine if the increase in GABA levels with gabapentin treatment translates into clinically measurable improvement in social cognition. The investigators will conduct an 8-week open-label clinical trial of gabapentin in 40 adolescents (age 13-17 years) with ASD, using MRS before and after treatment to measure GABA in the RAI (the primary outcome for the study). Before the trial, a single dose challenge of gabapentin will be used to evaluate the immediate response of GABA levels in the RAI, to determine if this predicts later response. A secondary outcome will be the clinical effects of gabapentin on social cognition. This study can demonstrate for the first time that neuroimaging biomarkers can be used to guide treatment of social cognition deficits seen in ASD and that the excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in neurotransmitters in ASD can be pharmacologically targeted. This can provide a rational basis for pharmacological treatment of the core social deficits of ASD, providing direct benefit to participants in the study as well as indirect benefit to countless patients in the future.",Biomarker-Driven Pharmacological Treatment of Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorder With Gabapentin,lauren.venuti@umassmed.edu|david.cochran@umassmed.edu,"Lauren Venuti|David Cochran, MD",23-Nov,Anticipated,Autism Spectrum Disorder,Autism|Autism Spectrum Disorder|Autism Spectrum Disorder,D000001321|D000067877|D000002659,"Autistic Disorder|Autism Spectrum Disorder|Child Development Disorders, Pervasive",,Single Group Assignment,None (Open Label),,Treatment,,"Outline of Research Plan The investigators will recruit 40 adolescents with ASD (age 13-17) to participate in an 8-week open label clinical trial of gabapentin, with wraparound neuroimaging to assess the primary outcome of Aim 1 (response of RAI GABA levels to 8 weeks of gabapentin treatment) and Aim 2 (evaluation of acute response to gabapentin as a predictor of response at 8 weeks). Clinical measures of social cognition described below will be obtained to address Aim 3 (to assess for clinically measurable improvements in social cognition deficits).||Clinical Assessments The subjects will be assessed with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) to confirm the diagnosis of ASD. The Ohio Autism Clinical Impressions Scale will assess overall severity of autism-specific symptoms. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID 7.0.2) will be used to document comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. The Weschler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence (WASI-2) will be used to assess IQ. Social cognition deficits will be assessed using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test (RMET), the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2), and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II (VABS-II) Socialization subdomain. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist, Community version (ABC), will be used to quantify behavioral measures associated with ASD. To assess whether clinical improvements with gabapentin extend beyond effects on social cognition, other symptom domains will be assessed pre- and post-treatment as well. Specifically, information on repetitive and/or compulsive behaviors will be obtained using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (CY-BOCS-PDD). The ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD RS-IV) will be used to assess ADHD symptoms, the Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS) to assess depressive symptoms and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, 2nd edition, (MASC-2) will be used to assess anxiety-related symptoms.||In addition to traditional outcome measures for social functioning in ASD, including parent report measures (SRS-2) and theory of mind tasks (RMET), a novel technique of measuring social motor coordination will be used that was developed as a potential outcome measure in ASD clinical trials. This assessment involves a video-based analysis of whole-body social motor coordination during a more naturalistic task, the conversation task of an ADOS-2 administration. Changes in social motor coordination will be evaluated in relation to changes in GABA levels with treatment over the course of the clinical trial.||Baseline MRI T1- and T2-weighted high-resolution structural imaging (T1- and T2-weighted (MPRAGE)) will be acquired, along with a baseline MRS using MEsher-Garwood Point REsolved Spectroscopy Sequence (MEGA-PRESS: TE: 68 ms, TR: 2 s) to quantify GABA in a 4 cm x 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm voxel localized in the RAI. Imaging sessions will be conducted at the Advanced MRI Center (AMRIC) at UMMS, which houses a 3.0 Tesla Philips Achieva MRI research scanner (Philips Healthcare, Best, Netherlands) and 8 element phase-array receiver SENSE head coil.||The baseline MRI protocol also leverages collaborations with the Human Connectome (HCP) and Adolescent Brain Cognitive Developments (ABCD) projects and is designed to support integration with national multi-site studies for added protocol utility. The scan session will include 1) a 3D T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo scan for cortical and subcortical segmentation (6.5 min); 2) a 3D T2-weighted variable flip angle fast spin echo scan for screening out white matter lesions and quantification of CSF (6 min); 3) a diffusion imaging scan, for segmentation of white matter tracts and measurement of diffusion parameters (1.5mm isotropic, b=1000; 110 directions acquired with both AP and PA phase encoding; 2 x 5 min); 4) a resting state fMRI scan (2mm isotropic ; TR 750 ms; AP, PA phase encoding; (2-5.75 min runs).||Acute Response of GABA levels A second MRS scan will be obtained two hours after an approximately 20 mg/kg challenge with gabapentin to obtain the acute response for Aim 2. Subjects will receive a single dose of gabapentin. The dose used will be calculated to provide the highest possible dose to the nearest 100 mg without exceeding 1500 mg or 20 mg/kg, whichever is lower. The weight exclusion criteria ensures that all subjects will receive at least 17 mg/kg dose. All subjects will be monitored for adverse effects for up to 4 hours following administration of the single dose and will have direct phone access to the principal investigator (24 hours/ 7 days a week) for reporting of any post-observation adverse effects. A blood sample to assess drug level will be taken as close to 3 hours after administration as possible, allowing time for imaging scan and transport to clinical trials unit for blood draw. This will be used to control for variability in bioavailability in interpreting the cortical GABA level changes.|Clinical Trial of Gabapentin The study involves an 8-week open-label clinical trial with gabapentin in 40 adolescents age 13-17 years who meet DSM-5 criteria for ASD. At the acute gabapentin dosing visit, baseline safety labs will be obtained, including complete blood count; comprehensive metabolic panel including electrolytes, renal function tests, and liver function tests; and creatine kinase. Baseline EKG will be obtained as well. The above labs will be repeated at week 4 and week 8 of the clinical trial, or if adverse events occur which indicate the need for testing.||At baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, and 8, the following clinical measures will be obtained: OACIS-S, OACIS-I (for post-baseline visits). At baseline and at 8 weeks, the following assessments will also be administered: VABS-II, SRS-2 (modified to ask about symptoms in previous 2 weeks), RMET, ABC, CY-BOCS-PDD, ADHD-RS-IV, MASC-2, and CDRS-R. ADOS-2 will also be re-administered at week 8 for videotape assessment of social motor coordination as described above. At week 8, a trough serum gabapentin level will be obtained to account for variability in bioavailability as a potential confounding factor. At week 8, the MRS scan will be repeated to evaluate RAI GABA levels, and also include a resting state functional MRI scan.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Age 13-17 years|English as primary language (both child and legal guardian)|DSM-5 criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder|IQ >70 per Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI)|Informed assent for the study (The guardian must also give written informed consent)|For sexually active females, agreement to use two forms of contraception during trial to avoid pregnancy||Exclusion Criteria:||Any neurological disorder (e.g., cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome, cerebral neoplasm, bacterial meningitis, epilepsy, etc.)|Genetic disorders (e.g., Fragile X, Rett Syndrome, etc.)|Contraindications for MRI, such as metallic or electronic implants in the body, or severe claustrophobia|Unstable psychiatric disorder expected to require psychotropic medication changes over the course of the study|History of psychotic disorder|Any condition that would prevent the subject from being able to complete study protocol|Unstable medical illness such as diabetes, asthma, thyroid disease|Currently on medications that cause respiratory depression, e.g. opioids, benzodiazepines|Clinically significant suicidal ideation as assessed by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale|History of intolerance to gabapentin or pregabalin|Current substance use (including nicotine)|Current treatment with gabapentin|History of renal dysfunction|Subjects who weigh more than 88 kg|Pregnancy in female participants.",40,Anticipated,,,,,,All,No,Yes,Gabapentin Open-label treatment,"8 weeks of gabapentin, titrated up to 20 mg/kg in 3 divided doses daily",Gabapentin,,Drug,Yes,,8-Oct-21,Actual,30-Sep-21,OTHER,David Cochran,Worcester,,,United States,University of Massachusetts Medical School,Massachusetts,,17 Years,13 Years,Biomarker-Driven Pharmacological Treatment for Autism Spectrum Disorder,OTHER,"University of Massachusetts, Worcester",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UMass Medical School,Not yet recruiting,No,Phase 4,23-Nov,Anticipated,Cortical GABA Levels in right anterior insula as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy,Right Anterior Insula GABA level,8 weeks,,,"University of Massachusetts, Worcester",David Cochran,Assistant Professor of Psychiatry and Pediatrics,Sponsor-Investigator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21-Nov,Anticipated,21-Sep,Child,1-Oct-21,Actual,21-Sep-21,21-Sep-21,,Interventional,15-Oct-21,,No

It is a pervasive developmental disorder affecting social, communicative, and compulsive/repetitive behaviors characterized by stereotypic complex hand and body movements, craving for sameness, and narrow repetitive interests. Autism severely impacts both the affected individual and family members.||The proposed study is designed to assess the efficacy of treatment with Galantamine vs. placebo in childhood/adolescent autism fulfilling DSM-IV and Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI) criteria.

Subjects will not be responsible for the costs of any evaluations or tests conducted as part of this study.||First, subjects will receive a psychiatric and medical evaluation by the study psychiatrist to see if she/he has any psychiatric or medical illnesses that would interfere with their ability to participate in this study. These evaluations may take up to an hour to complete. In addition, subjects will be asked to participate in a psychiatric interview designed to determine the child's diagnosis and current problem areas. The subject's parent will also be asked to fill out psychiatric questionnaires. The interview and questionnaires may take up to 4 hours to complete.||Second, urine and blood samples will be needed for routine tests two times during this study (before any study related tests are done, and at the end of the study). Two teaspoons of blood will be drawn each time. The urine sample will be analyzed in order to assess kidney function and to screen for the presence of drugs (such as cocaine, marijuana, heroin, etc.). A positive drug screen would result in the inability of the child to participate in this study. Drug screen results will be kept confidential. In addition, an electrocardiogram will be performed to determine heartbeat.||Lastly, a pregnancy test will be conducted on the urine sample if the child is female and has reached puberty. The child should not be in this study if she is pregnant or a nursing mother. A positive urine pregnancy test would cause the child to be removed from the study. If the child is sexually active, she must be using an effective method of birth control during her participation in this study. Acceptable methods of birth control are oral contraceptive medications (the administration of which must be parentally supervised), IUD, depot medication and tubal ligation.||Subjects will be assigned by chance to receive either the active medication (Galantamine) or placebo (sugar pill) for 12 weeks, much like the flip of a coin. Neither the parent/child nor the investigator will know which of the two treatments the child is receiving. The child has a 50% chance of being assigned to receive placebo during the study or the active medication, Galantamine, during the study.||The child will need to be seen weekly by the study psychiatrist for the first 4 weeks of the twelve-week study, and every other week for the remaining weeks of the study.

Eye-tracking data was recorded at 300 Hz sampling rate using a Tobii T300 computer (Tobii Technology, Danderyd, Sweden). The actual data given by the computer represents the percentage of time spent looking at a novel visual target - this is called the novelty score.

Duration of testing was 2 minutes.|Visual attention is indexed by duration and number of fixations on novel target on testing. The standard method of assessing visual attention in neuropsychology is by measuring:||A)number of fixations (how many times the subject looks at each of the 2 visual targets).

Children with PDD show delays in speech and language and reduced social interaction. Some children with PDD have also have problems with overactivity, impulsiveness and distractability. These behaviors are seen in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Extended release guanfacine (Intuniv) is FDA-approved for the treatment of children with ADHD. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether Intuniv is an effective treatment for ADHD symptoms in children with PDD.||This study has four parts: an 8-week double-blind trial, an 8-week blinded extension phase (for positive responders only), an 8-week open-label trial, and a 4-week add-on study. Following confirmation of eligibility, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either guanfacine or placebo in the 8-week double-blind trial. Children who show improvement after 8 weeks of treatment will continue on their assigned treatment for an additional 8 weeks (blinded extension phase). Children who show partial improvement with guanfacine will be offered 4 weeks of treatment with guanfacine plus methylphenidate (add-on study). Children who show no improvement on placebo will be offered 8 weeks of treatment with guanfacine (open-label trial). Children who show no improvement on guanfacine will exit the study.||Side effects and treatment response will be assessed at regularly scheduled visits.||The study protocol was formally revised with the Yale University IRB in May 2013 to address an early close to enrollment due to a reduction in funding.

In the third domain repetitive and stereotyped behavior as hand- and finger mannerisms, unusual sensory interest or activities are investigated by four subscales. Most items are scored from zero to three, relying on the interviewer to make judgements on child's behaviour based on the recall of information from parents/carers. .

It consists of four modules, each of which is appropriate for children, adolescents and adults of differing developmental and language levels, ranging from no expressive or receptive language to verbally fluent adults. The examiner selects the module that is most appropriate for a particular child, adolescent on the basis of his/her expressive language level and chronological age. Selected algorithm items relating to social interaction and communication are then entered into an algorithm. The scores must meet the separate cut-offs for both the communication and social domains and the cut-off for the summation of the two.

ASD is defined by impairments in social-communication as well as the presence of restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. ASD is frequently associated with co-occurring language delays. Currently the only well-accepted treatment for core ASD symptoms is behavior therapy such as Applied Behavioral Analysis and Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention. There is no US Food and Drug Administration approved medical therapy that addresses core ASD symptoms or the pathophysiological processes that underlie ASD.||The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a liquid form of leucovorin calcium on language impairments in very young children with ASD. Participants entered into the trial will have delayed social and communication abilities known to be associated with ASD. The investigators hypothesize that leucovorin calcium will significantly improve language as well as core and associated behavioral symptoms of ASD, and be well-tolerated with no significant adverse effects, in young children with ASD. The investigators further hypothesize that a combination of baseline cellular and genetic biomarkers will predict cognitive and behavioral response to the intervention.||To assess whether the liquid form of leucovorin calcium is superior to placebo, the investigators will study 80 children across two sites, between the ages of 2.5 and 5 years, with confirmed ASD and known language delays at baseline. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive active treatment or placebo for 12 weeks under double-blind conditions.

ASD is defined by impairments in social-communication as well as the presence of restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. ASD is frequently associated with co-occurring language delays. Currently the only well-accepted treatment for core ASD symptoms is behavior therapy such as Applied Behavioral Analysis and Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention. There is no US Food and Drug Administration approved medical therapy that addresses core ASD symptoms or the pathophysiological processes that underlie ASD.||The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a liquid form of leucovorin calcium on social and communication impairments in very young children with ASD. Participants entered into the trial will have delayed language and moderate ASD symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that leucovorin calcium will significantly improve social communication as well as core and associated behavioral symptoms of ASD, and be well-tolerated with no significant adverse effects, in young children with ASD.||To assess whether the liquid form of leucovorin calcium is superior to placebo, the investigators will study 80 children across two sites, between the ages of 2.5 and 5 years, with confirmed ASD and known social and communication delays at baseline. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive active treatment or placebo for 12 weeks under double-blind conditions. At the end of 12 weeks, all participants will receive active treatment for 12 weeks. Language skills and social communication abilities will be measured at screening and after each treatment arm in order to determine if the supplement positively influences social communication. Additionally, the investigators will measure changes in neural pathways using either magnetoencephalography at Phoenix Children's Hospital or functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy at State University of New York, Downstate. While these measures will be considered exploratory, they will be important to begin to elucidate the neuronal mechanisms underlying leucovorin's impact.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||1.

This would be a novel study as there is no known safety or efficacy data for amphetamine based medications in this population. In addition, although health related quality of life and executive function are known to improve with the treatment of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in the ADHD population (Banaschewski 2013; Findling 2009; Turgay 2010), it has not been shown in the co-morbid ADHD and ASD population. ADHD is the most common pediatric neurobiological condition affecting approximately five percent of the pediatric population (Feldman 2009). ASD is being increasingly recognized as affecting a substantial amount of the pediatric population, with recent prevalence data showing 1 in 68 affected (Baio, 2014). Prior to the introduction of DSM-5 (APA, 2013), exclusion criteria precluded the diagnosis of ADHD when ASD was present. Studies have shown that 41%-71% of children with ASD also meet criteria for ADHD (Goldstein 2004, Sturm 2004,Yoshida 2004, Gadow 2006). This means that up to 1% of the population may have co-morbid ADHD and ASD. With the official recognition of this comorbidity, treatment of comorbid ADHD when ASD is also present has been increasingly recognized as an important strategy in improving executive functioning and quality of life in those affected. Studies have indicated that some of the medications commonly used to treat ADHD, are effective and safe when used in comorbid ADHD and ASD. At this time, there have been well designed studies demonstrating safety and efficacy for methylphenidate (Ghuman et al. 2009; Handen et al. 2000; Quintana et al. 1995; RUPP 2005), guanfacine XR (Posey 2004; Scahill 2015), and atomoxetine (Arnold 2006; Harfterkamp 2012).",Evaluation of the Effect and Safety of Lisdexamfetamine in Children Aged 6-12 With ADHD and Autism,suzannah.wojcik@cfpe.ca,Suzannah Wojcik Clinical Research Coordinator,21-Oct,Anticipated,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|Autism Spectrum Disorder,Hyperactivity|Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|Autism|Autism Spectrum Disorder,D000006948|D000004194|D000001321|D000001289|D000067877,Hyperkinesis|Disease|Autistic Disorder|Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity|Autism Spectrum Disorder,,Single Group Assignment,None (Open Label),,Treatment,,"ADHD is the most common pediatric neurobiological condition affecting approximately five percent of the pediatric population (Faraone, Stephen V., Sergeant, J. et al. 2003; Feldman & Belanger 2009). ASD is being increasingly recognized as affecting a substantial amount of the pediatric population, with recent prevalence data showing 1 in 68 affected (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2010). Prior to the introduction of DSM-5, exclusion criteria precluded the diagnosis for ADHD when ASD was present (American Psychiatric Association 2013). Studies have shown that 41%-71% of children with ASD also meet criteria for ADHD, meaning up to 1% of the population may have comorbid ADHD and ASD (Goldstein & Schewbach 2004).||With the official recognition of comorbidity, treatment of comorbid ADHD when ASD is also present has been increasingly recognized as an important strategy in decreasing ADHD symptoms, and improving executive functioning and quality of life of those affected. Studies have indicated that some of the medications (methylphenidate, guanfacine XR and atomoxetine) commonly used to treat ADHD are effective and safe when used in comorbid ADHD and ASD (Ornstein & Kollins 2012; Ghuman et al. 2009; Handen et al. 2000; Quintana et al. 1995; Posey et al. 2004; Scahill et al. 2015; M. et al. 2012). While amphetamine class compounds are amongst the first line of treatment in ADHD, the lack of studies in this population has discouraged their use in subjects with comorbid ADHD and ASD.||The lack of safety and efficacy data is problematic as it limits therapeutic options for the population of subjects with ADHD and ASD. Amphetamines and methylphenidate medications are equally considered first line treatment options for ADHD (CADDRA 2011). Some subjects may preferentially respond to one group of medications over another, therefore it is important to have clear safety and efficacy data for both therapeutic options.||A retrospective chart review of this population indicates that treatment is started with methylphenidate versus combined amphetamine/dextroamfetamine at a ratio of 2.78:1 (Stigler et al. 2004). Due to the availability of evidence of efficacy in this comorbid population, clinicians may choose to skip to what is considered a second line medication for ADHD symptomatology rather than using LDX (or another amphetamine-based ADHD medication such as dexedrine or Adderall XR) that may have a larger effect size for treating these symptoms.||LDX has been shown to be an effective treatment for ADHD in subjects 6 and above. With long lasting effectiveness shown to last up to 14 hours, it could potentially improve ADHD symptoms and overall quality of life for children and adolescents with ADHD and ASD in home, school and after-school functioning.||The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LDX in treating ADHD when ASD is co-morbid.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Male or female subject aged 6-12 years at the time of consent/assent.|Subjects parent(s) or legally authorized representative (LAR) must provide signature of informed consent, and there must be documentation of assent (if applicable) by the subject in accordance with the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guideline E6 (1996), any updates or revisions, and applicable regulations, before completing any study related procedures.|Subject and parent(s)/LAR are willing and able to comply with all of the requirements defined in the protocol.|Subject meets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-V) criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD combined presentation, inattentive presentation or hyperactive/impulsive presentation based on history and a minimum ADHD-RS score of 32 and a minimum CGI-S of 4 at baseline.|Subject meets DSM-V criteria for a diagnosis of ASD-level 1 based on history and Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS-2).|Subject has an SRS-2 total score of ≥ 70.|Subject has a Clinical Global Impressions - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score ≥ 4 at the baseline visit (visit 2)|Subject has a blood pressure measurement within 95th percentile for age, and sex (Appendix 1,1.1,2 & 2.2).

Specific clinical trials in patients with synaptic mutations need to be carried out. In this spirit, patients with deleterious mutations in SHANK3 represent a paradigm. The induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSc) carrying SHANK3 mutations and derived in neurons, can be used for high-throughput screening of pharmacological substances and allow the identification of compounds that can restore the expression level of SHANK3.

Examination of whether changes in the activity of key pathways/proteins influenced by fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) (the mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) and MMP-9) are biomarkers of treatment responsiveness. Because lovastatin is also an anti-inflammatory, characterization of MEK/ERK signaling in peripheral immune cells both pre- and post- treatment will be carried out to determine whether levels of these signaling molecules are predictive biomarkers of treatment response. It is hypothesized that those individuals with elevated inflammatory cytokine profiles will be most responsive to lovastatin treatment. Once modeled in FXS, results from these studies can then be applied to other neurodevelopmental disorders including RASopathies.||The behavioral component of the proposed multi-modal treatment will be a Parent-implemented Intervention (PILI) that targets improvements in spoken language and challenging behavior for 10- to 17-year-olds with FXS by increasing parental verbal responsiveness (PVR) within picture-book based story-telling episodes. Parents will be encouraged to use the targeted strategies in other everyday interactions with their child.

The alterations in central and peripheral serotonin neurobiology and in circadian sleep-wake rhythms observed in autistic disorder suggest abnormalities in melatonin secretion.||Several studies have reported a decrease in melatonin secretion in individuals with autism. Furthermore, nocturnal excretion of 6-Sulphatoxymelatonin (the predominant melatonin metabolite) was significantly negatively correlated with severity of autistic impairments in verbal communication and play. Melatonin could therefore have a therapeutic effect on sleep problems and may play a role in the pathophysiology of autistic disorder.||These data highlight the possible therapeutic interest of an oral administration of melatonin in patients with autistic disorder.

Melatonin produced in the pineal gland helps regulate human circadian rhythms including sleep-wake, and is considered as the best measure of circadian rhythms.||Several studies revealed that plasmatic and urinary nocturnal levels of melatonin are significantly lower in individuals with autism (in particular, in prepubertal children) compared to typically developing individuals. In addition, this reduction in nocturnal melatonin was significantly associated with the severity of communication and social interaction impairments, especially in verbal communication and play. Finally, diurnal excretion of melatonin was also found to be decreased in individuals with autistic disorder.||Given these results, administration of melatonin could serve, at least in prepubertal children wih autism, to normalize physiological, developmental and behavioral processes that are influenced by this pineal hormone.

It is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of metformin (also known as Glumetza, Glucophage, Fortamet), a type 2 diabetes medication that can also improve obesity and excessive appetite.||Metformin has emerged as a candidate drug for the targeted treatment of FXS based on animal studies showing rescue of multiple phenotypes in the FXS model. Metformin may contribute to normalizing signaling pathways in FXS in the central nervous system, which may include activities of mTOR and PI3K, both of which have shown to be pathogenically overactive in FXS. In addition, metformin inhibits phosphodiesterase, which would lead to correction of cAMP levels, and MMP9 production, which is also elevated in FXS. Looking at the potential signaling pathways, metformin appears to be a good candidate for targeting several of the intracellular functions in neurons disrupted in FXS and, therefore, has potential to rescue several types of symptoms in individuals with FXS. The researchers have utilized metformin in the clinical treatment of over 20 individuals with FXS between the ages of 4 and 58 years and have found the medication to be well tolerated and to provide benefits not only in lowering weight gain and normalizing appetite but also in language and behavior. In this controlled trial, the researchers hope to further assess metformin's safety and benefits in the areas of language and cognition, eating and weight loss, and overall behavior.||Each participant will be involved in this trial for a period of 4 months. This will include 3 visits to the UC Davis MIND Institute and 5 phone calls. At each visit, the researchers will assess behavioral, cognitive, and language development.

It is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of metformin (also known as Glumetza, Glucophage, Fortamet), a type 2 diabetes medication that can also improve obesity and excessive appetite.||Metformin has emerged as a candidate drug for the targeted treatment of FXS based on animal studies showing rescue of multiple phenotypes in the FXS model. Metformin may contribute to normalizing signaling pathways in FXS in the central nervous system, which may include activities of mTOR and PI3K, both of which have shown to be pathogenically overactive in FXS. In addition, metformin inhibits phosphodiesterase, which would lead to correction of cAMP levels, and MMP9 production, which is also elevated in FXS. Looking at the potential signaling pathways, metformin appears to be a good candidate for targeting several of the intracellular functions in neurons disrupted in FXS and, therefore, has potential to rescue several types of symptoms in individuals with FXS. Researchers have utilized metformin in the clinical treatment of over 20 individuals with FXS between the ages of 4 and 58 years and have found the medication to be well tolerated and to provide benefits not only in lowering weight gain and normalizing appetite but also in language and behavior. In this controlled trial, the researchers hope to further assess metformin's safety and benefits in the areas of language and cognition, eating and weight loss, and overall behavior.||Each participant will be involved in this trial for a period of 4 months. This will include 3 visits to one of the sites and 5 phone calls. At each visit, the researchers will assess behavioral, cognitive, and language development.

Analysis will be performed utilizing the Sansone et al. (2012) FXS-normed ABC scoring measures.|The CGI is a clinician-rated scale utilizing history from the caregiver and incorporating it into a clinical rating, first for severity, and then for clinical follow-up. The CGI-S will be used at the baseline assessment to judge symptom severity as 1 = Normal, not at all ill; 2 = Borderline ill; 3 = Mildly ill; 4 = Moderately ill; 5 = Markedly ill; 6 = Severely ill; and 7 = Among the most extremely ill. The CGI-I will be used at the Week 8 and End of Treatment/Week 16 visits to judge the change in clinical impression as 1 = Very Much Improved; 2 = Much Improved; 3 = Minimally Improved; 4 = No Change; 5 = Minimally Worse; 6 = Much Worse; and 7 = Very Much Worse.|The VAS will be used to measure the severity of three specific behavioral symptoms targeted in this study: behavior problems, language abilities, and eating behavior. For each behavior the caregiver is instructed to mark their impression of the behavior at the baseline visit and again at the Week 8 and End of Treatment/Week 16 visits. The calculated distance in cm between the visit marks thereby demonstrates whether each behavior stayed the same, improved, or worsened during the study and by how much. The scale is from 0 cm (defined as ""worst behavior"") to 10 cm (""behavior not a problem"").|The VABS-III is a caregiver survey interview that measures the personal and social skills of individuals from birth through adulthood. It was designed to assess handicapped and non-handicapped persons in their personal and social functioning and is appropriate for individuals of all ages.

The EQ-5D consists of a descriptive system and the EQ VAS. We will use the EQ-5D-Y, EQ-5D-Y parent proxy, EQ-5D-3L, and EQ-5D-3L parent proxy depending on the participants age and ability. The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. This can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the patient's own judgement. The scores on these five dimensions can be presented as a health profile or can be converted to a single summary index number (utility) reflecting preferability compared to other health profiles.|The CarerQol was designed to measure and value the impact of providing informal care on carers. It combines a subjective burden measure that provides a comprehensive description of the caregiving situation (CarerQol-7D) with a valuation of informal care in terms of well-being (CarerQol-VAS).|This is an online test developed in the Bolduc Laboratory done on a tablet at home. Participants are asked to remember association between sets of pictures. The test has been done in typical development and developmental delay for participants 4 years and up.

Encoding, storage, and retrieval of episodic memories depend on a neural network including the temporal lobe (especially the hippocampus), the prefrontal cortex, and limbic/temporal association areas. Patients with FXS perform approximately two standard deviations below normal on PSM, which demonstrates good feasibility, test-retest reliability in both healthy children and those with ID; and moderate correlation with FSIQ.|Flanker is a measure of inhibition and visual attention. On each trial, a central directional target is flanked by similar stimuli on the left and right. The participant chooses the direction of the central stimulus. On congruent trials, the flankers face the same direction as the target. On incongruent trials, they face the opposite direction. Patients with FXS demonstrate profound deficits on Flanker, performing about 7 standard deviations below normal, and significantly worse than IQ-matched controls with Down syndrome. This test demonstrates excellent test-retest reliability and correlates significantly with FSIQ and dialing functioning in children and adolescents with ID.|This is a measure of cognitive flexibility. Two target pictures are presented that vary along two dimensions (i.e., shape and color). Participants are asked to match a series of bivalent test pictures (e.g., yellow balls and blue trucks) to the target pictures, first according to one dimension (e.g., color) and then, after a number of trials, according to the other dimension (e.g., shape). ""Switch"" trials are also employed, in which the participant must change the dimension being matched. It demonstrates good test-retest reliability and correlates well with FSIQ in children and adolescents with ID, including FXS .|This test requires immediate recall and sequencing of different visually and orally presented stimuli. Pictures of different foods and animals are displayed with accompanying audio recording and written text (e.g., ""elephant""), and the participant is asked to state the items in size order from smallest to largest, first within a single dimension (either animals or foods, called 1-List) and then on 2 dimensions (foods, then animals, called 2-List). The raw score is the number of items recalled and sequenced correctly.|This test measures speed of processing by asking participants to discern whether two side-by-side pictures are the same or not the same by touching ""yes"" or ""no"" (or a happy or frowning face for lower mental age).

The items are designed to be simple to distinguish.|The participant is asked to read and pronounce letters and words as accurately as possible. The test administrator scores them as right or wrong. The items are administered by computer adaptive testing (CAT; continuously adapted depending on performance), and participant responses are scored by the examiner. For the youngest children, the initial items require identification of letters (as opposed to symbols) and identification of a specific letter in an array of 4 symbols. A theta score is calculated for this test.|This measure of receptive vocabulary is administered in a CAT format. The respondent is presented with an audio recording of a word and four photographs on the screen and is asked to select the picture that most closely matches the meaning of the word. A theta score is calculated for this test.|This test measures speed of processing by asking participants to discern whether four side-by-side pictures match the target image at the top of the screen. The items are presented one group at a time on the iPad screen, and the participant is given 119.999 seconds of actual presentation time (excluding transitions between items) to respond to as many items as possible (up to a maximum of 130). The items are designed to be simple so as to most purely measure processing speed. Speeded Matching gives a raw score, which is the number of items the participant correctly responds to (up to 130) in 119.999 seconds.|For individuals with FXS, we have demonstrated that the social gaze measure shows decreased visual fixations on the eye region while viewing human faces (with greater fixation to the nose region), and these individuals show abnormal pupillary dilation, an indication of sympathetic nervous system reactivity, compared with controls. While these measures do not appear to map directly onto caregiver-reported anxiety of the individuals level of anxiety, the results are consistent with high rates of social anxiety and sympathetic reactivity in FXS. Stimuli are presented on a Tobii T120 eye-tracker. The system has several benefits that make it conducive to testing individuals with developmental disorders. Stimuli consist of sixty colored photographs of adult human faces each showing a calm, happy, or fearful expression, and sixty scrambled versions of the face images.|Recently, researchers were able to obtain EEG recordings and ERP responses during an auditory oddball paradigm from patients with FXS enrolled in a controlled trial of minocycline. The study demonstrated the potential feasibility and sensitivity of ERPs as an indicator of cortical processing changes in a targeted treatment trial. It appears to provide a biomarker and measure for the human equivalent of cortical hyperexcitability. Additionally, we will administer a recently developed task looking at EEG habituation to pseudowords to assess word learning with EEG. Data is acquired using a Brainproducts Quickamp system. Raw data is imported into Brainvision Analyzer software for analysis. The continuous data is segmented according to the event type and filtered. We also analyze the EEG data at resting state for the oddball paradigm according to frequency distribution and the occurrence of spontaneous oscillations, and pseudoword habituation with ERP, energy and time-frequency analyses.|The Sensory Profile 2 family of assessments evaluates a child's sensory processing patterns in the context of everyday life. The forms are completed by caregivers, who are in the strongest position to observe the child's response to sensory interactions that occur throughout the day. The Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile was developed to assess sensory processing abilities in individuals beyond childhood. The Sensory Profile Adolescents/Adult is a self report, however, if the participant is unable to complete it themself, we will ask their caregiver to complete it and we will make note of who completed it. The French versions are the Profil sensoriel 2 and the Profil sensoriel-adolescent/adulte.","Change from baseline in the FXS-normed Aberrant Behavior Checklist - Community Edition (ABC-C)|Improvement of symptoms in FXS using the Clinical Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) scale|Change from baseline in the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)|Change from baseline in the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Third Edition (VABS-III) Adaptive Behavior Composite Score|Change from baseline in the Anxiety Depression and Mood Screen (ADAMS) overall score|Change from baseline in the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham Questionnaire (SNAP-IV) overall score|Change from baseline in the Pediatric Quality of Life Questionnaire (PedsQL) Parent Proxy overall score|Change from baseline in the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) overall score|Change from baseline in the Care Related Quality of Life (CarerQoL) overall score|Change from baseline in The Memory Game|Change from baseline in the Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) overall score|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox Picture Sequence Memory Test|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox Dimensional Change Card Sort Test|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox List Sorting Working Memory Test|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox Oral Reading Recognition Test|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox Picture Vocabulary Test|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox Speeded Matching Test|Change from baseline in Eye Tracking|Change from baseline in Event Related Potentials during the Auditory Oddball Paradigm and Pseudoword Paradigm|Change from baseline in the Sensory Profile-2 or Sensory Profile Adolescents/Adults","Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16",,,,,,,24-May-19,Actual,21-Sep,Child|Adult,5-Mar-19,Actual,26-Feb-19,1-Mar-19,,Interventional,15-Oct-21,,Yes

Due to the lack of known treatments for autism, many parents seek complementary and alternative medical (CAM) therapies hoping to help their affected child. Methylcobalamin (methyl B12) is a commonly used CAM treatment that has anecdotal reports of remarkable clinical improvements with few side effects. Prior studies have found that children with autism have deficiencies in key metabolites and antioxidants which can be caused by methyl B12 deficiency; additional studies have shown that methyl B12 normalizes deficiencies in these metabolites and antioxidants. Based on these reports, a pilot study was conducted at UC Davis on the effect of methyl B12 on the behavioral and metabolic measures in children with autism. The preliminary results of 29 subjects revealed a subgroup of 9 responders to clinical behavior assessments. These responders also demonstrated significant improvement on the plasma measures of antioxidant capacity, suggesting methyl B12 improves symptoms in a subgroup of children with autism by increasing key antioxidants. The current study will have an 8 week double blind design with 50 subjects, designed to evaluate improvements from methyl B12 by using behavioral assessments and analysis of specific metabolites in the subjects' blood. This study will determine whether methyl B12 will lead to benefits in any of the core features of autism, and will examine metabolic changes with the hope of potentially identifying a biomarker for treatment response in a subgroup of subjects.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Diagnosis of DSM IV defined autism and meets cut off on Autism Diagnostic Inventory-Revised (ADI-R) and/or the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS)|Age 3 through 7 years|IQ of 50 or above|Parental agreement to continue present dietary, behavioral or psychotropic drug treatment but not change treatment during 8 week intervention|Willingness to have blood drawn, without the use of a sedative prescription from the study doctor||Exclusion Criteria:||Bleeding disorder|Cancer|Seizure disorder|Fragile X or other known genetic cause of autism|Perinatal brain injury (i.e.: cerebral palsy)|Other serious medical illnesses|Current use of any B12 supplement",57,Actual,,,0,,,All,No,,Active|Placebo,75 µg/Kg subcutaneously injected once every 3 days|placebo,Methyl B12|Placebo,Vitamin B12|methylcobalamin,Drug|Dietary Supplement,,,24-Feb-17,Actual,4-Jan-17,OTHER,"University of California, San Francisco",San Francisco,,,United States,UCSF,California,,7 Years,3 Years,Double Blind Placebo Controlled Trial of Methyl B12 on Behavioral and Metabolic Measures in Children With Autism,OTHER,"University of California, San Francisco",2|3|1|2|7|2|1|5|3|1,23|27|23|27|23|27|23|27|23|27,2|3|1|2|7|2|1|5|3|1,cold|fever|increased hyperactivity|mouthing|trouble sleeping,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23|27,Participants,Placebo||Placebo: Syringes were tightly taped with opaque material to hide the color of the liquid|Active Methyl B12||Methyl B12: 75 µg/Kg subcutaneously injected once every 3 days,Placebo|Active,"PI assesses subject's change using the CGI-I measure.

The increase in the prevalence of autistic spectrum disorders from 4-5/10,000 in the 1980s to 30-60/10,000 in the last decade has raised great concern (Bertrand et al., 2001; DeStefano et al., 2004; Steinhausen et al., 1986; Yeargin-Allsopp et al., 2003). Research into potential therapeutic interventions designed to ameliorate the metabolic and clinical symptoms of autism is urgently needed to reduce the enormous public health burden of this disorder and to improve the quality of life for affected children and their families. Nutritional supplementation through subcutaneous injections of methyl B12 is a current treatment for children with autism that has anecdotal reports of remarkable clinical improvements and few side effects.

Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) does not specifically allow for a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD with ASD, many children with an ASD manifest symptoms of ADHD and are treated for it with stimulants or other medication. The few studies on ADHD in ASD have not consistently established its cognitive and behavioral manifestations, or the optimal parameters for treatment. The proposed project will address these issues through studies of cognitive and behavioral functioning in children with ASD, with and without ADHD, and through a study of medication treatment of ADHD symptoms in autism.||Participants between the ages of 7 to 12 with an autism spectrum disorder participated in the initial phase of the study to examine the nature and effects of ADHD symptoms on behavioral and cognitive functioning. Participants underwent an initial psychological testing session that included standardized measures of intellectual, adaptive behavior, language, behavioral, and emotional functioning, along with standardized diagnostic measures to confirm their diagnoses of ASD and/or ADHD (Visit 1). Children with intelligence quotients (IQs) below 50 or greater than 130 or with major sensory, motor, neurological, genetic, or psychiatric disorders that may interfere with testing were be excluded. The participants who meet eligibility criteria completed computerized tasks of attentional functioning in a second visit (Visit 2).||A subset of the children meeting criteria for the ASD/ADHD group (N=24) participated in a six-week randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trial using various doses (low, medium, or high dose) of methylphenidate (MPH). Children participated in the treatment trial will be those who qualified based on the initial phase and who do not have any physical contraindications to MPH (e.g., history of MPH intolerance). In each week of the treatment trial, the children took one of the three doses of MPH or a placebo. At the end of each week the child were evaluated in the clinic by including a medical check-up, parent interviews about the child's behavior and functioning that week, and computerized cognitive testing. Additionally, the child's parent and teacher completed questionnaires about the child's behavior each week, so that the child's home and school behaviors at each MPH dose could be assessed.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Autism/ADHD Group:||DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder, as per the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)|Child manifests current symptoms of ADHD||Autism/non-ADHD Group:||Meets the diagnostic criteria for autism, as above, but does not meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD||Exclusion Criteria:||In both groups, exclusion criteria will include:||Sensory or motor deficits sufficient to interfere with testing (e.g., blindness, severe cerebral palsy)|Serious neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy, stroke)|Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome, Tourette syndrome, or fetal alcohol syndrome|Bipolar disorder or a family history of bipolar disorder in a first-degree relative|Other serious psychopathology that resulted in psychiatric hospitalization (e.g., for psychotic episode).

If there are no concerns about safety and tolerability after 2 weeks of treatment, then the dose will be increased to 2 tablets of either high dose of active treatment or placebo. If at high dose there are concerns about safety and tolerability, then the dose will be either kept the same or reduced to low dose for the remainder of the treatment period.||The last 2 weeks of the treatment period will be a dose-maintenance period.

A recent study by Vargas and co-workers at Johns Hopkins has demonstrated that this regressive type of autism is associated with chronic brain inflammation as shown by an abnormal production of inflammatory cytokines among other abnormalities.||This present study will test the effectiveness of minocycline, an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties, in treating regressive autism. Although behavioral therapies have improved some symptoms of autism, there are no medical treatments for the disorder, and many children have ongoing behavioral difficulties. A medicine with anti-inflammatory properties may be beneficial for children with regressive autism.||This will be an open-label trial, meaning all children in this study will receive minocycline. They will also receive vitamin B6 to reduce the possible chance of side effects of the minocycline.||Children ages 3 to 12 with regressive autism may be eligible for this study. The children will take minocycline and vitamin B6 daily for 6 months. Prior to starting the medication and vitamin B6, children will receive a comprehensive diagnostic assessment for autism as well as a physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests. Children will then receive ongoing assessments to monitor their behavior, communication, language skills, and medical issues at 2 weeks, and at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 months. Children who respond to the treatment will receive an additional 3 months of minocycline and vitamin B6.",Minocycline to Treat Childhood Regressive Autism,,,11-Apr,Actual,Autism|Minocycline|Regressive Autism,Autism,D000001321,Autistic Disorder,,Single Group Assignment,None (Open Label),,Treatment,,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that results in abnormalities of social and language development and is associated with rigid and repetitive behaviors. Although there is strong evidence of heritability, the involved genes have not been identified. The prevalence of autism spectrum disorders may be as common as 1 in 166. The average concordance rate in monozygotic twins is 70% suggesting that environmental factors play a role in the disease. Subgroups of autistic children seem unusually sensitive to infections, immunizations and dietary factors, but none of these factors has been causally identified with the disease. Nevertheless, autoimmunity has been considered to play a role on the basis of indirect evidence. There is no evidence-based efficacious treatment for autism.||There is a subgroup of children with autism that appear to develop typically for a period of time, and then lose skills, or regress. A recent study by Vargas and co-workers at Johns Hopkins has demonstrated that the regressive subtype of autism is associated with chronic brain neuroinflammation as exemplified by activation of microglia and astroglia and the abnormal production of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors assayed in both tissue samples (brain banks) and CS. The authors remarked that these responses were similar to those seen in some neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and that chronic microglia activation appears to be responsible for a sustained neuroinflammatory response that facilitates the production of multiple neurotoxic mediators. Chronic neuroglial activation could be the result of an abnormal persistence of a fetal development pattern. In this scenario neuroglial activation could play a role in initiating and in maintaining the pathology. Alternatively, neuroglial activation may only be a secondary response to the initiating causal factor(s) and not a direct effector of injury. Since neuroglial activation requires the nuclear translocation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-kappa B, and since inhibitors of NF-kappa-B with good CNS penetrance are available, the role of neuroinflammation in initiating and sustaining the autistic condition can be probed.||The antibiotic minocycline is a powerful inhibitor of microglial activation, apparently through blockade of NF-kappa-B nuclear translocation. Minocycline is neuroprotective in mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's disease and has been recently shown to stabilize the course of Huntington's disease in humans over a 2-year period.||To evaluate the possibility of benefit in autistic children, we propose to conduct an open-label trial of the anti-inflammatory antibiotic minocycline, an agent that reduces inflammation by blocking the nuclear translocation of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kappa-B. Minocycline is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for treatment of a variety of infections and has been widely used for the treatment of adolescent acne. Minocycline is currently in phase III trials for the treatment of Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.||This proposal is for an initial 6-month, single-arm, off label, open-label study (with a 3 month extension phase offered to responders) that will evaluate dose safety and efficacy of minocycline in 10 children, ages 3 to 12 years, with a primary diagnosis of autism and a history of developmental regression. The subjects will be evaluated by a diagnostic/behavioral assessment, and the extent of neuroinflammation judged by CSF cytokine/chemokine profiles before and after the 6-month treatment.

This syndrome is caused by a microdeletion in chromosome 7q11.23 that encompasses loss of the elastin locus.||Elastin, which is part of the extracellular matrix, controls proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and stabilizes arterial structure. Loss of elastin gene in WBS patients has been claimed to provide a biological basis for the abnormal elastic fibre properties leading to cardiovascular abnormalities like supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS), hypertension, arteriosclerosis and stenosis in more than 50% of WBS children.||These cardiovascular pathologies result in important consequences and neither curative nor preventive medicinal treatments exist at this time. Surgery is needed in more than half cases, while it is often leading to complications.||Minoxidil is a well-known antihypertensive drug used in adults and children. Furthermore, according to animal studies, minoxidil seems to increase arterial elastin content by decreasing elastase activity in these tissues. Other data demonstrate that minoxidil specifically stimulate elastin synthesis.||Working Hypothesis:If insufficient elastin synthesis leads to vascular complications and arterial hypertension in children with WBS, restoration of sufficient quantity of elastin should then result in prevention or inhibition of vascular malformations and improvement in arterial tension. Therefore, as a pharmacological agent capable to stimulate elastin expression, minoxidil might be a useful drug for the treatment of abnormal elastin metabolism in WBS children.||Objective:To evaluate the efficacy of minoxidil on cardiovascular structure in children with Williams Beuren syndrome.||Methodology: randomized controlled trial on two parallel group (23 patients in each arm) Main criterion:variation of carotid Intima-media thickness (IMT) before and after 12 months of treatment with Minoxidil versus placebo Secondary intermediate criteria of the vascular properties are arterial stiffness, cardiac and renal stenosis, arterial tension.||Total study duration:30 months including a 12 month-recruitment period",Efficacy of Minoxidil in Children With Williams-Beuren Syndrome,,,15-Aug,Actual,Williams Beuren Syndrome,Syndrome|Williams-Beuren Syndrome|Williams-Beuren Syndrome|Williams-Beuren Syndrome,D000018980|D000013577,Williams Syndrome|Syndrome,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Quadruple,,Treatment,Participant|Care Provider|Investigator|Outcomes Assessor,,,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||proven diagnosis of Williams Beuren syndrome (genetic test)|normotension or hypertension, treated or not|male or female,|6< age <18,|negative pregnancy test for childbearing potential female|effective birth control for sexually active female|signed consent form collected from parents or legal guardian||Exclusion Criteria:||pulmonary hypertension secondary to mitral stenosis|myocardial infarction within 1 month prior randomization|known allergies to minoxidil or any of the components of Lonoten.|asthma|renal failure (creatinine clearance <40ml/min)|no affiliation to a national health insurance program (social security)|intolerance to lactose|current vasodilator anti hypertensive treatment",21,Actual,,,5,,,All,No,,Minoxidil|Placebo,"Normotension: 0.2mg/kg/day for children under 12 and 5mg/day for children aged 12 or more.||Hypertension: 0.2mg/kg/day, increasing up to a maximal dosage of 1 mg/kg) for children under 12. 5mg/day, increasing as needed of 0.1 mg/kg/day (up to a maximal dosage of 40 mg/day) for children aged 12 or more.|Normotension: 0.2mg/kg/day for children under 12 and 5mg/day for children aged 12 or more.||Hypertension: 0.2mg/kg/day, increasing up to a maximal dosage of 1 mg/kg) for children under 12. 5mg/day, increasing as needed of 0.1 mg/kg/day (up to a maximal dosage of 40 mg/day) for children aged 12 or more.",Minoxidil|Placebo,,Drug|Drug,,,26-Jul-19,Actual,29-May-19,OTHER,Hospices Civils de Lyon,Angers|Bordeaux|Bordeaux|Bordeaux|Bron|Bron|Clermont-Ferrand|Grenoble|Lille|Lille|Nancy|Paris|Paris|Paris|Pessac|Poitiers|Toulouse|Toulouse,,,France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France,"Service de Cardiologie Pédiatrique, CHU Angers|Service de Cardiologie, Hôpital Saint-André, CHU Bordeaux|Service de Néphrologie Pédiatrique, Hôpital Pellegrin, CHU Bordeaux|Service de Génétique Médicale, Hôpital Pellegrin, CHU Bordeaux|Département de Pédiatrie, Hôpital Femme Mère Enfant|Service de Cardiologie Pédiatrique, Hôpital Cardiovasculaire L.

The turmoil caused by self-injurious behaviors in children with ASD invariably interferes with daily routines because family life often stops during these episodes and family members worry about setting off SIB between episodes. This project will use the detailed assessment methods developed in the field of behavior therapy to evaluate the potential for N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to treat children with ASD and moderate repetitive SIB. NAC is an over-the-counter dietary supplement that may have beneficial effects on the brain through its well-documented antioxidant effects and/or reduced glutamate signaling. In the proposed study, 14 children with ASD and repetitive SIB between the ages of 5 and 12 will be randomly assigned to gradually increasing doses of NAC or placebo for 9 weeks. The research team, parents and children will be blind to the treatment with NAC or placebo. Participants will come to the research site periodically to complete measures and behavioral assessments.||After the 9 weeks of treatment, children randomized to NAC who showed improvement will be encouraged to continue taking the supplement outside the study. Children who were randomly assigned to the placebo and showed no improvement will be offered open-label treatment with NAC. Children who did not improve while taking NAC or those who improved while on the placebo will be advised on next steps by the study team.||The goal of this feasibility study is establish the acceptability viability of study procedures in this vulnerable population, to learn about the potential benefits and adverse effects of NAC. Demonstrating these feasibility aims and the preliminary efficacy and safety of NAC is a prerequisite for planning a larger, more definitive, study.",,,,,Inclusion Criteria:||Confirmed diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)|Confirmed presence of moderate Self Injurious Behavior (SIB)|Score > 16 on the parent-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability subscale (moderate level of disruptive behavior)|Classified as having automatically maintained SIB (determined during screening by a detailed functional analysis)||Exclusion Criteria:||On a stable medication dose for less than 4 weeks|Planned change in medication during the 9-week trial|Had one or more seizures in the last 6 months,8,Actual,0|0,1|1,0,9 weeks,,All,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,No,Participants taking NAC|Participants taking Placebo,"Participants will start with taking 900mg of NAC once per day for one week (study days 1-7).

It is possible that children with Autism tend to have lower levels of glutathione, an important compound in our bodies that helps combat the effects of toxic free radicals.

Maintenance of sleep is a significant challenge in the treatment of children with neurodevelopmental disabilities including ASDs. Night awakening or early morning waking can have detrimental effects on these children's daytime behavior and the functioning of their household. Sleep problems in the ASD population are generally managed first with behavioral interventions and, when these are not successful, pharmacologic therapy. Most medications effect sleep onset and not sleep maintenance. This study investigates the effectiveness of Melatonin CR for managing ISM in 4-8 year old children with ASD. Twenty patients will be recruited from the Developmental/Behavioral Pediatrics Clinic at the Munroe Meyer Institute at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Inclusion criteria are male and female children ages 4-8 years with a diagnosis of an ASD, including Pervasive Developmental Disorder NOS (PDD, NOS), Asperger's Syndrome, or Autistic Disorder, parent/guardian consent for participation, stable psychotropic medication treatment for at least 4 weeks, and a documented history of ISM based on parent-report, somnolog and Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), and a clinician rating of ≥4 (moderately ill) on the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) Scale. Patients will be excluded if they have been treated with Melatonin or Melatonin CR in the past month, failed treatment with Melatonin CR, or if they have a previously un-evaluated medical condition which may be causing the ISM. Following the completion of a somnolog and standardized questionnaires, the patients will be treated for 10-14 days with melatonin CR. Somnologs will be completed during treatment, and standardized parent questionnaires, CGI-S, and adverse event collection will be repeated at the end of Melatonin CR therapy. Response will be defined as a Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score of 1 or 2 (much or very much improved). These will be compared to baseline ratings. Following the completion of the study protocol, all patients will continue to be followed in the Developmental Pediatrics clinic. Data from this acute pilot trial can be used to evaluate the appropriateness of a larger study to determine optimal therapy for patients with ASD and ISM.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Male or female children,|ages 4-8 years,|diagnosed with an ASD, including|Pervasive Developmental Disorder NOS (PDD, NOS),|Asperger's Syndrome, or|Autistic Disorder, and followed in the Munroe Meyer Developmental Pediatrics Clinic.

Clinically, Fragile X Syndrome is characterized by intellectual handicap, hyperactivity and attentional problems, autism spectrum symptoms, emotional lability and epilepsy. The epilepsy seen in Fragile X Syndrome is most commonly present in childhood, but then gradually remits towards adulthood. Physical features such as prominent ears and jaw, and hyper-extensibility of joints are frequently present but are not diagnostic. Intellectual handicap is the most common feature defining the phenotype.

The investigators will recruit approximately 40 young-adult, male individuals with a clinical diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Participants will be randomly allocated to an experimental group (Oxytocin (OT)) and a control group (Placebo (PL)). All participants will receive the same frequency and duration of intervention. Behavioral and neural outcome measures will be assessed at multiple time points in a period of a year. Participants will be tested at 5 occasions: before and after a single dose of nasal spray, after multiple doses of nasal spray (1 daily dose of nasal spray during 4 weeks), after a 4-week retention period and after a 1-year retention period. At each time point participants will be tested at both the behavioral and neural level. Test performance of both participant groups (OT vs PL) will be compared by measuring reaction times and accuracy rates in a computerized task assessing a person's ability to recognize bodily emotional states from point light displays. In addition, attachment, social functioning, restricted behaviour, general quality of life and mood will be assessed via self-reported questionnaires.||Functional MRI measurements will be performed in a 3T MR Philips Intera scanner. Before scanning, subjects will undergo a training session to familiarize them with the task instructions. In addition to the fMRI measurements, resting state fMRI and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) will also be performed to reveal alterations of the functional and structural connectivity between critical regions.||Statistical analysis of the behavioral data will have a between-subject factor of group (OT vs PL) and within-subject factors of time (change-from-baseline). Image analysis will be performed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software. The investigators will contrast for either decreased or increased activation, as different regions may show divergent changes due to the received nasal spray (either OT or PL).",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Clinical diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder, Asperger Syndrome or Autism|Male|Age between 18 and 40 years old||Exclusion Criteria:||Associated neuro(psycho)logical disorder (i.e. epilepsy, concussion, stroke)|Eye sight worse than + or - 7|Genetic syndrome|Color blindness|Any contraindication to neuroimaging research as assessed with the MRI screening list:||MRI contraindications:||pacemaker, implanted defibrillator, ear implant / a cochlear implant, insulin or implanted pump, a neurostimulator or VP shunt, any metallic object in the eyes (metallic fragments)",40,Actual,0|0,22|18,5,Adverse event data were collected over a period of (approximately) four weeks.,,Male,No,No,"Syntocinon (Oxytocin, product code RVG 03716)|Placebo (Physiological water(sodium chloride (NaCl) solution))","Syntocinon nasal spray.

(IN-OT) on the resting state functional connectivity between key socio-emotional and social salience brain regions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Resting state functional connectivity is a task-independent metric of brain activity that is based on correlations between low-frequency fluctuations of the blood oxygen level-dependent signal between several brain regions. It reflects the strength of a functional connection that is in good agreement with the underlying neuroanatomy and provides a system-level understanding of brain function. Z-scores represent the number of standard deviations from the mean of 0 and range from -3 to +3, and z-scores greater than 0 indicate greater than average resting state functional connectivity.|BOLD activity level was assessed via fMRI during completion of the face perception task (FPT) of emotional and neutral faces. BOLD scores are reported on a z-scale, with the mean, standard deviation and the minimum and the maximum. This refers to the non-thresholded z-scores that are obtained for each dose before conducting small volume correction analysis.|BOLD activity in social-emotional brain regions during the perception of emotional facial videos were measured during the ball-game task. Mean percent change in contrast of parameter estimates in anatomical regions of interest are presented here. A positive value indicates increased BOLD activity while a negative value indicates decreased BOLD activity.|Plasma concentration of oxytocin prior to administration of study intervention and after administration of study intervention will be compared between the different dose levels and placebo. Plasma concentration of oxytocin is expected to increase following administration of intranasal oxytocin.|Clinical improvements will be rated by a clinician as based on a videotaped interview conducted after the MRI scanning session. Values between the different treatment conditions will be assessed to study the effect of intranasal oxytocin on ASD at the clinical level. The improvement will be assessed based on the quality of social interaction between the experimenter and the participant, specifically as the amount of smiling behavior displayed by participants. Larger values indicate that participants are smiling more frequently.|Eye gaze will be recorded via an eye tracker inside the MRI scanner during the face perception task (FPT). Visual fixation between different treatment conditions will be assessed in ASD participants.|During the SLT, participants complete an implicit association test using faces and words. The faces that are presented in this task are partners' faces with whom participants played during the ball-game inside the MRI scanner. In this task, there are congruent blocks where neutral faces of ""positive"" partners are presented with friendly words and neutral faces of ""negative"" partners are presented with unfriendly words. During incongruent blocks, neutral faces of ""positive"" partners are presented with unfriendly words and neutral faces of ""negative"" partners are presented with friendly words. Participants match the face or the word to one of two categories. Longer reaction time indicates difficulty with selecting a category. Longer reaction time in incongruent trials signifies implicit biases were formed for the positive and negative players such that ""positive"" partners from the ball-game are now perceived as friendly and ""negative"" partners are now perceived as unfriendly.",Standard Deviation|Full Range|Standard Error|Standard Deviation|Standard Deviation|Standard Deviation|Standard Deviation,Mean|Mean|Mean|Mean|Mean|Mean|Mean,"This analysis includes participants with complete data for all visits.

University,Completed,No,Phase 2,3-Oct-18,Actual,"Investigators will study the effects of intranasal oxytocin (IN-OT) on the resting state functional connectivity between key socio-emotional and social salience brain regions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Resting state functional connectivity is a task-independent metric of brain activity that is based on correlations between low-frequency fluctuations of the blood oxygen level-dependent signal between several brain regions. It reflects the strength of a functional connection that is in good agreement with the underlying neuroanatomy and provides a system-level understanding of brain function. Z-scores represent the number of standard deviations from the mean of 0 and range from -3 to +3, and z-scores greater than 0 indicate greater than average resting state functional connectivity.|BOLD activity level was assessed via fMRI during completion of the face perception task (FPT) of emotional and neutral faces. BOLD scores are reported on a z-scale, with the mean, standard deviation and the minimum and the maximum. This refers to the non-thresholded z-scores that are obtained for each dose before conducting small volume correction analysis.|BOLD activity in social-emotional brain regions during the perception of emotional facial videos were measured during the ball-game task. Mean percent change in contrast of parameter estimates in anatomical regions of interest are presented here. A positive value indicates increased BOLD activity while a negative value indicates decreased BOLD activity.|Plasma concentration of oxytocin prior to administration of study intervention and after administration of study intervention will be compared between the different dose levels and placebo.

Values between the different treatment conditions will be assessed to study the effect of intranasal oxytocin on ASD at the clinical level. The improvement will be assessed based on the quality of social interaction between the experimenter and the participant, specifically as the amount of smiling behavior displayed by participants. Larger values indicate that participants are smiling more frequently.|Eye gaze will be recorded via an eye tracker inside the MRI scanner during the face perception task (FPT). Visual fixation between different treatment conditions will be assessed in ASD participants.|During the SLT, participants complete an implicit association test using faces and words. The faces that are presented in this task are partners' faces with whom participants played during the ball-game inside the MRI scanner. In this task, there are congruent blocks where neutral faces of ""positive"" partners are presented with friendly words and neutral faces of ""negative"" partners are presented with unfriendly words. During incongruent blocks, neutral faces of ""positive"" partners are presented with unfriendly words and neutral faces of ""negative"" partners are presented with friendly words. Participants match the face or the word to one of two categories. Longer reaction time indicates difficulty with selecting a category. Longer reaction time in incongruent trials signifies implicit biases were formed for the positive and negative players such that ""positive"" partners from the ball-game are now perceived as friendly and ""negative"" partners are now perceived as unfriendly.",Rate of Smiling During Global Clinical Interview|Milliseconds of Visual Fixation|Social Learning Test (SLT) Reaction Time,"Post Intervention (Up to 180 minutes after receiving spray) at Study Visits 1, 2, 3 and 4|Post Intervention (Up to 50 minutes) at Study Visits 1, 2, 3 and 4|Post Intervention (Up to 130 minutes) at Study Visits 1, 2, 3 and 4",,,,,,,10-May-17,Actual,20-Dec,Adult,27-Jan-17,Estimate,24-Jan-17,24-Jan-17,,Interventional,15-Oct-21,,Yes

In contrast to the ABC-Lethargy subscale it eliminates question 3 (listless, sluggish, inactive), question 32 (sits or stands in one position for a long time), and question 53 (inactive, never moves spontaneously). Thirteen individual items are scored 0-3, therefore the range is 0-39. Higher score indicates lower social reciprocity.

The adaptive behaviors are reverse scored so that all the analyzed scores range from 0-performing in a neurotypical fashion to 3 typically performs in a way associated with ASD. the total # of items on this summed measure is 31 with a range from 0 to 93.

Oxytocin (OT) is a neurohormone involved in both repetitive/rigid and social behaviors. This study is focusing on how a single dose of intranasal OT (IN-OT) affects cognitive rigidity and social perception tasks. Taking OT as a spray through the nose increases social and decreases repetitive behavior in some adults with ASD, and we are exploring if it helps children with ASD similarly. However, it is unclear whether every person with ASD has an abnormal OT level, and if OT affects restrictive or social behavior differently. Consequently, we aim to study whether OT treatment can be effective in treating subgroups with specific features of ASD. We will use approaches utilizing both behavioral and physiological responses to clarify the role of OT in ASD. We will develop a deeper understanding of the range of social and rigid behaviors and use that information to identify persons with ASD who would benefit from OT treatment. Potential subjects will be asked if they want to participate in two sessions in our clinical laboratory where they will get either single dose IN-OT or placebo. After receiving the substance, they will be asked to do a handful of tasks while we monitor heart rate, eye movements, and collect baseline and post intranasal blood, urine and saliva. The levels of hormones, metabolites and peptides related to or interacting with OT will be measures in the collected samples of blood plasma, urine and saliva.

Generally, mirror responses are larger upon the observation of actions accompanied by relevant information for the observer, such as direct eye contact from the actor. In other words, 'mirroring' is adaptively modulated according to the social salience of the observed actions (i.e. it is socially adaptive).||Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are known to endure difficulties with correctly recognizing eye contact as a communicative cue. Instead, they tend to experience eye contact as stressful and arousing. It is therefore hypothesized that, upon the observation of actions combined with salient gaze cues from the actor, these mirroring processes will not be adaptively modulated in participants with ASD.||As appropriate processing of eye contact is a key aspect of (non-verbal) communicative behavior, the investigator will investigate the efficacy of a single dose of intranasal oxytocin administration for enhancing socially-adaptive mirroring in ASD. Oxytocin is a neuropeptide that acts as a regulator social brain areas. On a behavioral level, it is known to enhance the saliency of observed social cues and to improve prosocial behavior.

A number of researchers have suggested that the neuropeptide oxytocin may be implicated in the etiology of autism.||Given the likely possibility of dysregulated oxytocin in autism, the goal of this pilot study is to investigate the long-term therapeutic effects of oxytocin in the treatment of autism. One practical issue with oxytocin is that it does not exist in a pill form. Only the intravenous form is available in the United States and this form may or may not pass the blood-brain barrier. In addition, intravenous oxytocin is not practical for treatment studies. One alternative is intranasal oxytocin; this form of administration is known to pass the blood-brain barrier, and it is easy for participants to self-administer. Although not available in the United States, we are in the process of receiving an Investigational New Drug exemption for its use and can import it from Europe.||Thus, this pilot investigation will explore daily intranasal oxytocin in the treatment of autism. Also, there are very few, if any, outcome measures to assess social functioning in the ""real world"" in the context of clinical trials; yet, this is a major target for intervention, especially in autism. Thus, a final goal of this study will be to explore the use of Event Contingent Recording to index changes in social functioning and affect. Event Contingent Recording is a methodology developed by personality/social psychologists, which allows participants to report on symptoms, affect, and behavior close in time to experience. In addition, to enabling more sensitive assessments, this methodology allows for the assessment of more diverse (e.g., at home versus work) and more detailed measurements of mood and behavior.||Finally, a portion of this study aims to perform gene expression profiling using fresh whole blood to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying oxytocin therapy and oxytocin efficacy in adults with high functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome. The systemic effects of oxytocin therapy and the molecular basis for a positive treatment response to oxytocin are not well understood. An understanding of the former may help predict those persons who may suffer side-effects from treatment and the latter may help provide easily accessible peripheral biomarkers that could predict treatment response.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Male or female outpatients 18 to 60 years of age.|Meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision.

The biologic actions of oxytocin on social cognition and prosocial behaviors and the clinical, genetic and epigenetic evidence for involvement of the oxytocin system in the pathophysiology of some cases of autism strongly suggest that supplemental oxytocin therapy could significantly improve the social disabilities involved in autism. Many people feel that these social difficulties are the most characteristic and central feature of autism. Overall, this study aims to determine the tolerability, accessibility, and feasibility of an oxytocin pilot study.||This study will consent up to 30 subjects in order to randomize up to 25 subjects into a 2-month (8 weeks) randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled initial treatment period, a subsequent 2-month (8 weeks) period in which all participants receive oxytocin, and up to three post-treatment visits that occur at week 28 (±2 weeks),an interim visit anytime between week 16 and week 76 only for those patients who plan to start oxytocin on their own outside of study treatment and who will experience a lag time between week 16 (end of open label treatment) and when outside oxytocin treatment will begin, and some time before week 76.

It is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum which affects an estimated 1 in 88 children in the United States. At present, pharmacotherapies target only associated features of autism, with no effective drug treatments for the social impairments. Several lines of evidence now suggest that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) may be an effective treatment for the core social deficits in autism. Here we will test the effects of twice daily intranasal OT (24 IU) over a 4-week period for enhancing social deficits in male and female children aged 6-12 years with autism. This research has high potential to lead to the development of more effective treatments and earlier interventions for children with autism.",Intranasal Oxytocin Treatment for Social Deficits in Children With Autism,,,16-May,Actual,Autism,Autism,D000001321,Autistic Disorder,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Quadruple,,Treatment,Participant|Care Provider|Investigator|Outcomes Assessor,"In recent years, the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has been implicated in a wide range of social behaviors including attachment bonds, emotion recognition, eye gaze to social cues, and memory for social information. Social impairments represent one of the most intractable features of autism, and evidence now suggests that OT biology is dysregulated in individuals with this disorder. The central aim of the research outlined here is to test whether OT administration to children with autism increases their quality and quantity of social interactions and enhances their ability to process emotional and social information. Findings from initial single-dose OT administration studies in teenaged and adult males with autism have shown improvement in some aspects of social functioning, but replication and extension to well-controlled treatment trials with younger male and female subjects is necessary to evaluate effectiveness. We therefore aim to investigate the effect of intranasal OT on social cognition and behavior immediately following a single-dose (24IU) and following a 4-week period of OT (24IU BID) administration in a sample of 50 subjects with autism aged 6 to 12 years. The primary outcome for this study is change in social behavior, as determined by parent ratings on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) after the 4-week treatment period. Secondary outcomes are changes in functioning on laboratory-based measures of social behavior and cognition following single-dose and 4-week OT administration. Research in a small study sample (N=13) also identified treatment responders and non-responders to a single-dose of OT. Thus, we also aim to identify biological and cognitive and behavioral variables (i.e., pretreatment levels of social functioning and pretreatment plasma hormone levels) that may influence treatment response efficacy in our larger study sample. On completion of the 4-week treatment period all subjects will have the option of participating in another 4-week double-blind trial in which they will be switched to the alternate nasal spray to that which they previously received. They will then undergo a fourth and final assessment time-point using the same testing procedures as outlined above on completion of the 4-week dosing. By providing subjects with the option of participating in a second 4-week treatment trial, all subjects will have an opportunity to receive the active oxytocin nasal spray. We also will be able to examine any ongoing effects of oxytocin treatment in the group receiving placebo during the second 4-week administration period. Subjects not willing to take part in the second trial will exit the study and will be referred to their treating physician.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Medically healthy outpatients between 6 and 12

205,NCT02104011,STBETA,,Drug: Propranolol,Propranolol,,,,,,,,,Patient,Experimental,"Treatment of angiomyolipomas is based on invasive techniques such as surgery or embolization. Development of anti-angiogenic therapies is a major and growing field of research in hypervascularized tumors. Angiomyolipomas have been shown to regress after prolonged treatment with mTOR inhibitors (Sirolimus), but with a large proportion of secondary effects. We showed recently that beta-blockers were able to induce regression of infantile hemagiomas. Consequently, we looked for and found, histologically, in a few cases of angiomyolipomas the presence of beta2 receptors.||The aim of the study is to estimate if beta-blockers could induce regression or stabilization of renal angiomyolipomas in tuberous sclerosis in a pilot study.",Treatment of Renal Angiomyolipomas in Tuberous Sclerosis by Beta-blockers,,,22-Nov-17,Actual,Renal Angiomyolipomas|Tuberous Sclerosis,Sclerosis|Tuberous Sclerosis|Angiomyolipoma|Tuberous Sclerosis,D000014402|D000018207|D000012598,Tuberous Sclerosis|Angiomyolipoma|Sclerosis,,Single Group Assignment,None (Open Label),,Treatment,,,,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Tuberous sclerosis patients with one or several angiomyolipomas of a size of at least 4 cms.||Exclusion Criteria:||Patients whom CT or MR scan shows one or several intra-lesional aneurisms requiring a preventive embolization.|Patients with a retroperitoneal hemorragic complication requiring a preventive embolization.|Patients whom biopsy will show an adenocarcinoma, hypertension non controlled, renal failure and severe liver.|Diabetic subjects insufficiently controlled.|Beta-blockers contra-indication.|Psychosis, severe mental disorder.|Patient already treated with beta-blockers or mTOR inhibitors.|Pregnant or nursing women.",2,Actual,,,,,,All,No,,Patient,,Propranolol,,Drug,,,23-Jan-18,Actual,19-Jan-18,OTHER,"University Hospital, Bordeaux",Bordeaux,,,France,Nephrology department,,,,18 Years,Treatment of Renal Angiomyolipomas in Tuberous Sclerosis by Beta-blockers: Pilot Trial,OTHER,"University Hospital, Bordeaux",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UH Bordeaux,Completed,Yes,Phase 2,22-Nov-17,Actual,Stabilization or even regression of angiomyolipomas volume after 6 months and 1 year of treatment with a quantification of the vascular component.,Evolution of angiomyolipomas volume,6 months and 1 year after inclusion,,,,,,Sponsor,,,,,Improvement of renal function after 6 months and 1 year of treatment|Haemorraghic transformation of angiomyolipomas is diagnosed by Scanner or MRI.|Th evolution of the quality of life is assessed by an EVA scale and by QOL scale.|Evolution of the face angiofibromas by a dermatologic assessment.,Renal function evolution|Effect on the potential haemorraghic transformation|Improvement of the quality of life|Effect on face angiofibromas,6 months and 1 year after inclusion|6 months and 1 year after inclusion|6 months and 1 year after inclusion.|6 months and 1 year after inclusion,,,,,,,22-May-15,Actual,18-Jan,Adult|Older Adult,4-Apr-14,Estimate,1-Apr-14,3-Apr-14,,Interventional,15-Oct-21,,No

Investigators are doing research in order to identify possible neurocognitive benefits from treatment with RAD001 or placebo for a six month period. There may also be potential for improvements in seizure frequency, sleep and autistic behaviors. We hope this trial will lead to a better understanding of TSC and to new forms of treatment, to benefit children and adults with TSC in the future.||Individuals diagnosed with TSC will be asked to participate in this study if they are between the ages of 6 and 21 years of age and have an IQ of greater than or equal to 60. Both males and females will be asked to participate. Additionally, to be eligible for study participation, individuals must have been on the same seizure medication(s), if applicable, for at least 6 months. Individuals must also be able to participate in neuropsychological testing and meet certain medical criteria. They will need to sign an informed consent. If enrolled in the study, participants will have a number of screening tests to help determine if they are eligible for participation in the clinical trial. If eligible for the treatment phase of the trial, they will be asked to take either the study drug or a placebo (pill with no medicine), which is determined by chance.||The study involves about 9 visits, 3 of which can be done locally, over a six month period, as well as follow-up calls with our research nurse. Study visits will vary in length. Screening, three month and six month visits may last up to 8 hours, while all other visits will be less than 2 hours. The study visits include blood draws, laboratory tests and neuropsychological assessments. There is no fee to participate in this study. The study drug will be provided at no charge during the study.||After all study data has been analyzed, families will be informed of the overall results.

It contains 39 items, of which a total of 30 are used to make up 7 different subscales. Scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating a greater level of functioning and QoL. The overall quality of life score is obtained by summing a linear combination of the 7 subscale scores, where each subscale is multiplied by a relative weight that is obtained from the patient's answer to 7 items of this questionnaire.|Comparison of adaptive functioning using the VABS-II composite score in the everolimus low-trough treatment arm (3-7 ng/mL), high-trough treatment arm (9-15 ng/mL) and placebo arm. The Vineland II assesses an individual's development of personal independence & social responsibility. The questionnaire contains 433 items which assess 15 subdomains organized into the five domains of Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, Motor Skills and Maladaptive Behavior. The overall Adaptive Behavior Composite (ABC) score is obtained by summing the standard scores of the first four domain scores for patients aged less than 7 years, or the first 3 domain scores for patients aged 7 or older (the Maladaptive Behavior domain is optional). The ABC standard score ranges from 20 to 160 with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Higher scores correspond to improved adaptive level. Note that 2 questionnaires with ABC scores<20 (data issues) were included in this analysis.|Comparison of adaptive functioning using the VABS-II composite score in the everolimus low-trough treatment arm (3-7 ng/mL), high-trough treatment arm (9-15 ng/mL) and placebo arm.

The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is a questionnaire used for suicide assessment developed by multiple institutions, including Columbia University, with NIMH support. The scale is evidence-supported and is part of a national and international public health initiative involving the assessment of suicidality. There are different scoring systems depending on the population. The important elements to note are that the higher the scores on the individual items and the more ""yes"" items, the higher the suicide risk.|The C-SSRS was completed at each visit.

Based on the raw scores obtained from the subtests, standardized z-scores were calculated for each subtest using the following formula: Zscore = (X - b)/Sb where X is the raw score of the subtest, b and Sb represent the mean and standard deviation respectively of the subtest score recorded at baseline for the study population. The composite WNV score was computed by summing up the Z-scores of the 3 subtests of the WNV (i.e. matrices, recognition, and coding for patients aged <8 years and matrices, spatial span, and coding for patients aged 8 to 21 years).

Response rate is the percentage of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in average weekly partial-onset seizure frequency during the maintenance period of the Core phase.|Percentage change from baseline in average weekly seizure frequency during the maintenance period of the Core phase is calculated as follow: (SFcfb) = 100 × (SFB - SFM) ÷ SFB where SFB is the average weekly seizure frequency in the Baseline phase and SFM is the average weekly seizure frequency in the maintenance period of the Core phase. A positive percentage change from baseline (SFcfb) means a reduction in seizure frequency whereas a negative percentage change from baseline (SFcfb) means an increase in seizure frequency.|A repeated measures analysis considering fixed 2-week intervals and including the level of exposure (time-normalized Cmin values), the time on-treatment and the seizure frequency at baseline quantified the estimated percentage change over 2 weeks in seizure frequency associated with a double exposure to everolimus, 15 days more on treatment and half the seizure frequency at baseline. A positive percentage change means a reduction in seizure frequency whereas a negative percentage change means an increase in seizure frequency.|Impact of everolimus on AED concentrations at trough. Pre-dose plasma samples to measure AED concentrations were measured at at Visits 1 (Screening), 2 (Baseline), 3, and 5. Effects of everolimus on the exposure of antiepileptic drugs was assessed by comparing the anti-epileptic drug concentrations at Visits 1 and 2 (AEDs alone) and at Visits 3 and 5 (AEDs plus everolimus).|Percentage change from start of everolimus in average weekly seizure frequency (SFcfe) = 100 × (SFe - SFtw) ÷ SFe where:||SFe is the average weekly seizure frequency in the 8-week period before start of everolimus SFtw is the average weekly seizure frequency in a 12-week time window A positive percentage change from start of everolimus (SFcfe) means a reduction in seizure frequency whereas a negative percentage change from start of everolimus (SFcfe) means an increase in seizure frequency.|Percentage of seizure-free participants for each 12-week time window.|Comparison of suicidality using the C-SSRS in the everolimus low-trough treatment arm (3-7 ng/mL), high-trough treatment arm (9-15 ng/mL) and placebo arm. The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is a questionnaire used for suicide assessment developed by multiple institutions, including Columbia University, with NIMH support. The scale is evidence-supported and is part of a national and international public health initiative involving the assessment of suicidality. There are different scoring systems depending on the population. The important elements to note are that the higher the scores on the individual items and the more ""yes"" items, the higher the suicide risk.|The C-SSRS was completed at each visit. The table below presents the number of patients who reported at least one completed suicide, one suicide attempt, one preparatory action toward imminent suicidal behavior, one suicidal ideation and one self-injurious behavior without suicidal intent at any time point after starting everolimus.","Percentage of Seizure-free Patients During the Maintenance Period of the Core Phase|Core Phase:

This is a pilot open labeled trial of growth hormone therapy in children with PMS targeting social withdrawal and repetitive behavior. This research study will include children with PMS between 2-12 years of age who will receive growth hormone daily for 12 weeks, if found to be eligible. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of growth hormone on behavioral outcomes such as the aberrant behavior checklist social withdrawal subscale (ABC-SW) and repetitive behavior scale- revised (RBS-R). The effects of growth hormone on visual evoked potentials will also be assessed. Growth hormone increases insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels and a previous trial of IGF-1 therapy in PMS children showed improvement in these behavioral scales. Growth hormone has been studied for decades with an excellent safety profile and fewer adverse effects compared to IGF-1 therapy in other conditions. Hence, this may be a viable therapeutic option.

IGF-1 promotes brain vessel growth, neurogenesis, and synaptogenesis.||The research team previous clinical trial of IGF-1 in patients with Phelan McDermid Syndrome has shown improvement in core ASD symptoms using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R). Growth hormone (GH) binds to its receptor and initiates a cascade of events which directly increases synthesis and release of IGF-1 levels. HYPOTHESIS: The study team hypothesize that rise in IGF-1 stimulated by growth hormone (GH) administration should produce improvement in behavior in children and adolescents with PMS as previously demonstrated with use of IGF-1.||RESEARCH PLAN: The study team seek to recruit 10 patients with PMS and administer growth hormone as once daily subcutaneous injections for 12 weeks at standard doses.

If a condition or illness is identified during the trial (and is determined to be unrelated to study treatments), referrals to outside medical care will be made. Study medications and all research-related materials and services will be provided at no cost to participants. Parking vouchers will be provided for all study-related hospital visits.||The study is investigating 5 potential effects:||IGF-1 may improve subjects' behavior, communication and/or mood. In order to measure this, investigators will evaluate subjects every 5 weeks throughout each treatment period with behavioral and psychological assessments. All of the tests used during these evaluations are non-invasive. Investigators will ask parents what their impressions are about their child's behavior and day-to-day activities through a structured parental interview and various questionnaires.|Investigators will examine subjects' brain function through use of a brain- monitoring device known as electroencephalography (EEG). The EEG measurements will be taken while investigators present subjects with exercises to stimulate their vision and hearing. EEG is a non-invasive way of recording the electrical activity of a subject's brain by applying a net of monitors (electrodes) to their scalp. Through this method investigators gain insight into how brain processes visual and auditory stimulus.|As one of the features of RTT is unstable vital signs, investigators are trying to determine if IGF-1 has any effect on normalizing subjects' heart rate and breathing patterns. To measure this, investigators will ask subjects to wear a non-invasive device that includes three electrocardiogram connectors and two stretchy bands that wrap around her chest and abdomen to measure heart rate and respiratory patterns.|The safety of IGF-1 in children with RTT is very important. Investigators will ask parents to complete a medication diary and side effect reporting form on a regular basis. In addition, laboratory tests will be performed every 10 weeks throughout each treatment period to evaluate the safety of IGF-1. These will be blood tests similar to those provided in typical clinical care. Subjects will undergo regular non-invasive comprehensive physical and neurological examinations, tonsil evaluation, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, scoliosis x-ray, bone age x-ray, ophthalmological exam, and measurements of height, weight and head circumference.|Children with RTT often experience unintended, stereotyped hand movements. The Qsensor® is a non-invasive device worn on a fabric bracelet that continually measures subjects' movement. Investigators will use the Qsensor® to determine whether or not IGF-1 affects the presentation of stereotyped hand movements. As such, investigators will ask subjects to wear the Qsensor® during study visits every 10 weeks throughout each treatment period and occasionally at home.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Diagnosis of ""classic"" (or ""typical"") Rett Syndrome|Genetic documentation of MECP2 mutation|Subject must be post-regression (Hagberg Stage 2)|Subject and caregiver's primary language must be English|Subject must reside in North America (US and Canada)|Caregiver must have internet access and be able to complete questionnaires online and communicate via email|Subject is stable on current medications for at least 4 weeks|Subject's regimen of non-pharmacological interventions (physical therapy, speech therapy, etc.) is stable for at least 90 days||Exclusion Criteria:||Severe scoliosis (curvature >40 degrees)|Bone-age greater than 11 years|Cardiomegaly (enlarged heart)|Tanner stage 2 or higher breast development|Allergy to IGF-1|Prior use of IGF-1, growth hormone, or sex steroids",30,Actual,0|0|0,30|30|30,0,80 weeks (from screening visit to 12-week follow up phone call).,,Female,No,,Treatment Period 1|Treatment Period 2|Treatment Period 1|Treatment Period 2,Subjects will receive twice daily subcutaneous injections of IGF-1.|Subjects will receive twice daily subcutaneous injections of a saline solution (placebo).,Recombinant Human Insulin Growth Factor 1 (rhIGF-1)|Placebo,mecasermin [rDNA] injection|Increlex|saline,Drug|Drug,Yes,,26-Mar-18,Actual,23-Mar-18,OTHER,Boston Children's Hospital,Boston,,,United States,Boston Children's Hospital,Massachusetts,,10 Years,2 Years,Pharmacological Treatment of Rett Syndrome by Stimulation of Synaptic Maturation With Recombinant Human IGF-1(Mecasermin [rDNA] Injection),OTHER,Boston Children's Hospital,0|0|2|0|1|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|1|0|2|0|2|4|1|2|1|0|1|1|0|0|1|1|0|1|1|2|1|1|1|0|1|3|1|2|0|0|2|1|0|0|1|4|1|0|1|0|0|2|0|1|0|0|1|1|0|1|1|0|0|0|1|0|2|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|1|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|1,30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30|30,0|0|2|0|1|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|1|0|2|0|2|4|1|2|1|0|1|1|0|0|1|1|0|1|1|2|1|1|1|0|1|4|1|2|0|0|2|1|0|0|1|4|1|0|1|0|0|2|0|1|0|0|1|1|0|1|1|0|0|0|1|0|2|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|1|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|1,"Abnormal ECG -

The higher the score, the more severe the symptoms of that subscale in the participant.||The range for each subscale is as follows:||General Mood: 0-16 Body rocking and expressionless face: 0-14 Hand behaviors: 0-12 Breathing Problems: 0-10 Repetitive Face Movements: 0-8 Night-time behaviors: 0-6 Walking Standing: 0-4||The fear/anxiety subscale was used as a primary outcome measure in this study and results can be found in that section.|Remaining subscales of the ADAMS that are not primary outcome measures include: Manic/hyperactive, Depressed mood, General anxiety, Obsessive/compulsive behavior.||The range for each subscale is as follows:||Manic/Hyperactive Behavior: 0-15 Depressed Mood: 0-21 General Anxiety: 0-21 Obsessive/Compulsive Behavior: 0-9||The higher the score for each subscale, the more problematic the behavior.|The MSEL is a standardized developmental test for children ages 3 to 68 months consisting of five subscales: gross motor, fine motor, visual reception, expressive language, and receptive language.||The raw score is reported for each subscale domain. The potential score ranges are as follows:||Visual Reception: 33 items, score range=0-50, Fine Motor: 30 items, score range= 0-49, Receptive Language: 33 items, score range= 0-48, Expressive Language: 28 items, score range= 0-50. The gross motor subscale was not included in this population.||A higher raw score indicates more advanced abilities in that section.|The VABS-II is a survey designed to assess personal and social functioning. Within each domain (Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, and Motor Skills), items can given a score of ""2"" if the participant successfully performs the activity usually; a ""1"" if the participant successfully performs the activity sometimes, or needs reminders; a ""0"" if the participant never performs the activity, and a ""DK"" if the parent/caregiver is unsure of the participant's ability for an item.||The raw scores in each sub-domain are reported and the ranges for these are as follows: [Communication Domain], Receptive Language=0-40, Expressive Language=0-108, Written Language=0-50; [Daily Living Skills Domain], Personal=0-82, Domestic=0-48, Community=0-88; [Socialization Domain], Interpersonal Relationships=0-76, Play and Leisure Time=0-62, Coping Skills=0-60; [Motor Skills Domain]: Gross Motor Skills=0-80, Fine Motor Skills=0-72.||A higher score indicates more advanced abilities.|The CSBS-DP was designed to measure early communication and symbolic skills in infants and young children (that is, functional communication skills of 6 month to 2 year olds). The CSBS-DP measures skills from three composites: (a) Social (emotion, eye gaze, and communication); (b) Speech (sounds and words); and (c) Symbolic (understanding and object use) and asks about developmental milestones. The data reported are the composite scores for these three categories.||The possible scores for the three composite categories are as follows:||Social Composite = 0-48; Speech Composite = 0-40; Symbolic Composite = 0-51.||A higher score indicates more advanced abilities in that area.|The ABC-C is a global behavior checklist implemented for the measurement of drug and other treatment effects in populations with intellectual disability. Behavior based on 58 items that describe various behavioral problems.||Each item is rated on the parents perceived severity of the behavior. The answer options for each item are:||0 = Not a problem||= Problem but slight in degree|= Moderately serious problem|= Severe in degree||The measure is broken down into the following subscales with individual ranges as follows:||Subscale I (Irritability): 15 items, score range = 0-45 Subscale II (Lethargy): 16 items, score range = 0-48 Subscale III (Stereotypy): 7 items, score range = 0-21 Subscale IV (Hyperactivity): 16 items, score range = 0-48 Subscale V (Inappropriate Speech) was not included in the breakdown because it was not applicable (no participants in the study had verbal language).|Respiratory data was collected using non-invasive respiratory inductance plethysmography from a BioCapture® recording device. BioCapture® is a child-friendly measurement device that can record from 1 to 12 physiological signal transducers in a time-locked manner. It can be configured with the pediatric chest and abdominal plethysmography bands and the 3 lead ECG signals we plan to use for monitoring cardiac safety throughout the study. Each transducer is placed on the patient independently to provide a customized fit that yields the highest signal quality for each patient irrespective of body shape and proportion. The transducer signals captured by the BioCapture® are transmitted wirelessly to a laptop computer where all signals are displayed in real-time.||The apnea index is given as apneas/hour. Data on apneas greater than or equal to 10 seconds are displayed below.

Children's Hospital,Completed,Yes,Phase 2,16-Jul,Actual,"The RSBQ is an informant/parent-completed measure of abnormal behaviors typically observed in individuals with RTT, which is completed by a parent/caregiver/LAR. Each item, grouped into eight domains/factors: General mood, Breathing problems, Body rocking and expressionless face, Hand behaviors, Repetitive face movements, Night-time behaviors, Fear/anxiety and Walking/standing), is scored on a Likert scale of 0-2, according to how well the item describes the individual's behavior. A score of ""0"" indicates the described item is ""not true,"" a score of ""1"" indicates the described item is ""somewhat or sometimes true,"" and a score of ""2"" indicates the described item is ""very true or often true.""||The total sum of items in each subscale is reported.||For the fear/anxiety subscale, the sum total could be between 0-8. The higher the sum total score, the greater the frequency of fear/anxiety behaviors.|The ADAMS is completed by the parent/caregiver/LAR and consists of 29 items which are scored on a 4-point rating scale that combines frequency and severity ratings. The instructions ask the rater to describe the individual's behavior over the last six months on the following scale: ""0"" if the behavior has not occurred, ""1"" if the behavior occurs occasionally or is a mild problem, ""2"" if the behavior occurs quite often or is moderate problem, or ""3"" if the behavior occurs a lot or is a severe problem.||The Social Avoidance subscale of the ADAMS will be used as a primary outcome measure for this trial. The range for this subscale is 0-21. The higher the subscale score, the more problematic the behavior.|This scale is used to judge the severity of the subject's disease prior to entry into the study. The clinician will rate the severity of behavioral symptoms at baseline on a 7-point scale from not impaired to the most impaired.||The scores that correspond to each possible grouping are as follows: 1=Normal, not at all impaired; 2=Borderline impaired; 3=Mildly impaired; 4=Moderately impaired; 5=Markedly impaired; 6=Severely impaired; 7=The most impaired.||The possible range for reported scores is 1-7.|Each time the patient was seen after the study intervention was initiated, the clinician compared the patient's overall clinical condition to the CGI-S score obtained at the baseline (visit 1) visit. Based on information collected, the clinician determined if any improvement occurred on the following 7-point scale: 1=Very much improved since the initiation of treatment; 2=Much improved; 3=Minimally improved; 4=No change from baseline (the initiation of treatment); 5=Minimally worse; 6=Much worse; 7=Very much worse since the initiation of treatment.||The possible range for reported scores is 1-7.|The PGI-S is the parent version of the CGI-S. Parents/caregivers/LAR are asked to rate the severity of their child's symptoms at baseline on a 7-point scale from not at all impaired to the most impaired.

BioCapture® is a child-friendly measurement device that can record from 1 to 12 physiological signal transducers in a time-locked manner. It can be configured with the pediatric chest and abdominal plethysmography bands and the 3 lead ECG signals we plan to use for monitoring cardiac safety throughout the study. Each transducer is placed on the patient independently to provide a customized fit that yields the highest signal quality for each patient irrespective of body shape and proportion. The transducer signals captured by the BioCapture® are transmitted wirelessly to a laptop computer where all signals are displayed in real-time.||The apnea index is given as apneas/hour.

Its presentation during childhood is similar to that seen in adulthood, except that children sometimes lack insight into the senselessness of the thoughts and behaviors. Although many patients benefit from treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a significant proportion have limited or no response to these medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may also be effective for OCD, alone or in combination with SSRIs, but there is a shortage of qualified therapists, and many patients and families cannot participate effectively in the therapy.||There is a pressing need, then, for the development of alternative, novel treatments for pediatric OCD. Neuropsychological and neuroimaging data suggest that OCD may arise from dysfunction of orbitofronto-striato-thalamocortical circuitry. Glutamate plays a crucial role in the regulation of excitatory activity within this circuit and may be involved in the etiopathogenesis of OCD. If so, then agents which reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission may provide unique antiobsessional benefits. Riluzole is a medication that reduces glutamatergic activity. A small open-label trial suggested that it might reduce OCD severity among children and adolescents.||The investigation will enroll up to 80 pediatric subjects with OCD including some who have both autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) and OCD. The subjects will participate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week trial of riluzole as a sole agent or as an augmentation to their currently inadequate therapy.

Children with PDD may show multiple, serious symptoms including hyperactivity, inattention, impulsive and aggressive behavior, repetitive movements or speech patterns, sleep disorders, screaming, and self-injurious behavior. Drug studies to date have suggested that different behavioral symptoms of PDDs respond to neuroleptics, such as risperidone. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of risperidone (0.02 to 0.06 mg/kg/day) compared with placebo in the treatment of behavioral symptoms in children 5 to 12 years of age with Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD). Patients receive study medication (risperidone or placebo) to be taken orally once a day at gradually increasing doses up to a maximum of 0.06 mg/kg, adjusted at weekly intervals to achieve optimal effectiveness while minimizing any intolerance to the drug. Treatment continues at the optimal dose through Week 8. A parent or caregiver evaluates the child's behavior and symptoms at scheduled office visits during the course of treatment. The primary measure of effectiveness is the change in the Irritability Subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and other ABC subscales at end of treatment compared with baseline. Additional assessments of effectiveness include: the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (N-CBRF); the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), a measure of the patient's most disturbing symptom; and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) of the overall severity of the disorder. Safety assessments include the incidence of adverse events throughout the study; measurement of vital signs (pulse, temperature, blood pressure), body weight, and evaluation of the presence and severity of extrapyramidal symptoms by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) at specified intervals; clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis) before study initiation and at the end of treatment. The study hypothesis is that risperidone is more effective than placebo for the treatment of behavioral symptoms in children aged 5 to 12 years with Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD).

Seventy-five percent of children and adolescents with autistic disorder have irritability symptoms such as aggression towards others, deliberate self-injurious behavior, temper tantrums, and quickly changing moods. These symptoms affect their daily functioning such as school performance, interactions with family members and compliance to treatment. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic agent that has been recently approved for the treatment of irritability associated with Autistic Disorder in children and adolescents aged 5 to 16 years. The approved dose range is 0.5-3 mg per day. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness (change in level of irritability and related behaviors) of a lower dose (0.125 mg or 0.175 mg risperidone per day depending on body weight). The study will include three treatment groups. A placebo group, a low dose risperidone group and a higher dose risperidone group (1.25 mg or 1.75mg per day depending on body weight). This phase of the study will be 6 weeks. During the study, neither investigators nor the patients will be told which treatment the patient received. This is called ""double blind"". The placebo treatment is not expected to be effective. The higher dose group is expected to be effective. At the end of the study, data from the lower dose group will be compared to the placebo group to see if it is effective. Another aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of risperidone. At the end of the 6-week double-blind period, patients may enter a 6-month open-label period during which all patients will receive risperidone. During this phase of the study, the doses can be adjusted to a maximum of 1.25 mg or 1.75mg per day depending on body weight. Both investigator and the patient will know what dose the patient is taking. About 93 patients will be randomized. The study will be conducted by investigators from about 15 clinics. Assessments of effectiveness include the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) subscales including the irritability subscale (ABC-I), the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI C); the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S); the response rate, and the Compulsions Subscale of the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY BOCS). Safety evaluations include monitoring of adverse events, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, nighttime sleep quality and daytime drowsiness, and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) as assessed using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) and the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS). Venous blood samples will be collected for the determination of plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone. The study hypotheses are that the higher dose level of risperidone is significantly superior to placebo as measured by change from baseline on the ABC-I Subscale score at end point (Week 6 or early withdrawal) and that the lower dose level of risperidone is significantly superior to placebo as measured by change from baseline on the ABC-I Subscale score at end point (Week 6 or early withdrawal). Double-blind phase: Risperidone oral solutions taken once daily. Depending on body weight patients take 1.25 mL or 1.75 mL of either a 0.1 mg/mL or a 1.0 mg/mL risperidone solution or matching placebo, for 6 weeks. Open-label phase: Medication can be taken once or twice a day. Starting from 0.125mg or 0.175mg per day, drug levels are titrated over 2 weeks to a maximum dose level of 1.25 mg risperidone/day or 1.75 mg /day depending on body weight, for 26 weeks.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||DSM-IV diagnosis of Autistic Disorder (299.00)|ABC-I Subscale score of greater than or equal to 18|CGI-S of greater than or equal to 4|mental age >18 months, body weight of at least 20 kg, seizure-free for at least 6 consecutive months and if on anticonvulsants must be on a dosage that has been stable for at least 4 weeks|Medication free for 1 week before the start of the study for all psychotropic drugs, except 4 weeks for fluoxetine and at least 8 weeks for injectable medications|Female patients must be premenarchal or sexually abstinent or, if heterosexually active, must practice an effective method of birth control.||Exclusion Criteria:||History of prior or current DSM-IV psychotic disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, other psychosis), Pervasive Developmental Disorder not otherwise specified (PDD NOS), Asperger's, or Rett's|Any history of hypersensitivity to risperidone, or its excipients in formulation, or other known drug allergy|Patients who received risperidone within 3 months before screening (except p.r.n. use)|Patients who did not demonstrate sufficient clinical response to an adequate trial of risperidone treatment in the past (an adequate trial is defined as a period of at least 4 weeks at an adequate dose)|Neurologic disorder (e.g., Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome, seizure disorders that are unstable, seizure activity within the past 6 months)|History of alcohol or substance dependence within 3 months of screening|Female subject who is pregnant (positive beta-HCG) or breast feeding|Patients with existing moderate or severe EPS or history of tardive dyskinesia|Patients who have received an experimental drug or used an experimental medical device within 3 months before the planned start of treatment.",96,Actual,,,5,Double-blind period: 6 weeks.

255,NCT00005014,,,,Risperidone,,,Yes,,,,,,,,"This study is designed to determine the effectiveness of risperidone, a drug treatment for the interfering symptoms of Autistic Disorder in children and adolescents between the ages of 5 and 17. Between 100 and 120 patients will be participating in this research study at five academic medical centers in the United States. The primary aim of the treatment is to reduce impairing behavioral symptoms such as aggression, explosive outbursts, or self-injurious behavior, without significant side effects. A secondary aim is to evaluate possible improvement in the level of social relatedness, attention, motor coordination, and short-term memory.||This study is a placebo-controlled, double-blind study (neither the investigators nor patients know if the treatment being given is risperidone or an inactive substance, placebo). Patients will be asked to participate for 6 to 8 months. For the first 8 weeks, patients will receive either risperidone or placebo, randomly chosen. At the end of the 8 weeks, those patients who have improved and were on risperidone will be asked to continue on this medication for another 4 months. The last two months of the study are again double-blind (neither patients nor investigators know treatment). Patients will either continue risperidone treatment or be gradually tapered from risperidone (placebo-substitution).

(2) Risperidone will result in more sedation (transient) and weight gain than placebo. (3) Patients continued on risperidone will be significantly less likely to experience exacerbation of symptoms of irritability, aggression, agitation, and stereotypy than those randomized to placebo, as measured by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), the Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Rating Scale, and the compulsions scale from the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS).

Additionally, skin-fold test and abdominal girth will be measured at baseline and endpoint.||Risks: Generally, metformin is well-tolerated. However, there may be unknown risks associated with exposure to a new medication in a clinical population where this specific compound has not been studied extensively. The general and rare side effects are listed below. These risks will be minimized by careful monitoring and higher than standard of care safety evaluations. In addition, an individual's symptoms could potentially remain unchanged or worsen by initiating this medication, or from delaying initiation of a potentially more effective alternative treatment. For these reasons, participation in the study is entirely voluntary and consent may be withdrawn at any time without any repercussions and will result in the patient being immediately discontinued from the study. If at any time the clinician believes that the patient is not benefiting from the study, the study will be discontinued and endpoint measures will be obtained if possible. A risk-benefit analysis, weighing clinical improvement against side effects will be done at each visit and will determine further inclusion in the study.||Subjects and their guardians will be asked repeatedly to inform study staff of any side effects. Subjects are informed of the potential side effects and the importance of alerting study staff to the side effects in the consent and assent forms. Side effect data will be collected at baseline and every other week, but subjects are encouraged to give relevant information at every clinical evaluation.||Alternative treatments include no treatment with an attendant risk of increased weight gain, potentially leading to health hazard.

Atypical antipsychotics are used in the treatment of a wide range of disorders in children and adolescents, such as; schizophrenia, bipolar mania, autistic disorder or other disruptive behavior disorders. This study does not involve using any new medication, but to look into some of the side effects that children and adolescents may experience from taking an atypical antipsychotic. One of the side effects of some atypical antipsychotics is an increased level of ""prolactin"", a hormone that occurs naturally in the body which can lead to ""hyperprolactinemia"" a condition in which the pituitary gland produces too much prolactin. In order to further investigate these possible side effects, two groups of children and adolescents (aged 8 to 16) with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar mania, autistic disorder, or conduct and other disruptive behavior disorders who are or have been recently treated with an atypical antipsychotic will be enrolled; 1 group of children and adolescents will either be currently taking or have recently been treated with risperidone and the second group of children and adolescents will either be currently taking or have recently been treated with an a similar type of atypical antipsychotic therapy. The results will then be compared to see if the age of physical maturation, growth and development differs between the two groups, using data collected during an office visit and previous information available from existing medical records. The patient's growth will be assessed using information on height and weight taken from the medical records at different time points before (up to one year previous) and since they started treatment with antipsychotic therapy. In addition, there will also be one visit to the clinic where the growth and stage of sexual maturity of the patient will be reviewed by both the study doctor and through the patient's own assessment, using a questionnaire and pictures developed specially to assess stages of physical development (so called - Tanner stage). In addition, one blood sample will be taken from each patient to check the levels of prolactin hormone in the blood to see if this differs between treatment groups. Potential patients will be identified through automated databases and/or medical chart review. If, after fully understanding the purpose of this study, the parent, legal guardian and their child agree to participate by signing an informed consent (children to sign an assent form), information (specified below) related to your child's treatment and development will be collected directly from central medical records or from notes kept by your child's doctor for evaluation. The following data will be collected from available medical records: information about the patient's use of antipsychotic drug and prescriptions; previous records of the patient's height, weight, and growth; physical and sexual development (so called, Tanner stage [developmental stage]) if available; results of previous blood tests taken to evaluate the level of the hormone prolactin if available; and, history of any side effects that could be related to increased levels of the hormone prolactin. All the above information will be collected within 1 year before the patient started antipsychotic therapy. The same information (if available) will also be collected following the time that the patient starting taking their atypical antipsychotic medication until the present time. As much information as possible will be collected for this period of time so that a determination of how taking antipsychotic drugs may have influenced the patient's growth can be made. The study doctor will see each patient for a single study visit. This visit will take place at a convenient time approximately one week after informed consent/assent has been obtained. At the clinic visit, the study doctor will do some examinations to check the patient's general health and assess their growth and physical development. These will include: a physical examination (including developmental stage assessment [Tanner stage]), weight and height, vital signs (pulse, respiration rate, temperature and blood pressure), medical history, and the collection of information regarding the occurrence of any side effects thought to be related to the use of atypical antipsychotic medication or related to the hormone prolactin. In addition to being assessed by the study doctor, the patient will be asked to complete the Tanner Stage questionnaire. This will involve the patient reviewing both pictures and written descriptions of children at different stages of physical development. The patient will have to decide which picture/description is most representative of their body. The study doctor will also look at the patient's current use of any other medications. Each patient will participate in the study for about one week. The outcome measures of the study will be to compare Z-scores for height, age at current Tanner stage, and prolactin-related adverse events between patients exposed to risperidone and patients exposed to other atypical antipsychotic drugs. Outcome measures will be collected during the study visit and retrospectively during the time of exposure for up to 2 years prior to the study visit.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||One or both parents

The study has two arms, one involving pre- and post-treatment MRS studies, and one without MRS. The MRS arm will study 18-20 subjects ages 6 and above, with a target of 14 completing patients. For both arms, we plan to a enroll at total of 30 patients to achieve completion for 24 patients. The non-MRS arm of the study will include subjects 6-18 years of age, the bulk of which have completed the study as of the writing of this updated revision.||Subjects will first undergo a screening visit during which safety and diagnostic assessments are completed, and a minimum of 3 days will be allowed to evaluate the screening results. Then, the subjects will complete one or two practice sessions to provide training to achieve the necessary stillness for a duration that is sufficient to complete a MRS session. Upon completion of successful practice sessions, subjects will then be scheduled for a MRS visit. Once the MRS is successfully completed, subjects will be assigned to receive risperidone 0.25 mg at their baseline visit.||Response to risperidone will be measured at weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12 by the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). Additional secondary outcome measures are shown below (figure 1). A post-treatment MRS will be conducted after the Week 12 or early termination visit. Subjects will be given adequate medication supply to cover through the day of the final MRS visit.||Study Medication. Because Asperger's Disorder is diagnosed in childhood and is considered a childhood disease, our previous phase of the study focused on subjects ages 6 - 18. Published dosages of risperidone used in child, adolescent, and adult studies ranges from 0.25 to 11 mg per day. Most studies in children and adolescents begin with a starting dose of 0.25 mg bid, which is also appropriate for adults, and will be the starting dose planned for this study. The study progresses from a fixed to a titrated dose paradigm. After Week 6, dose will be increased (based on response and tolerability), ranging from one to two tablets twice daily (either 1 or 2 mg of risperidone daily). Again at Week 9, dose will be increased (based on response and tolerability), ranging from 1 mg to 4 mg per day of risperidone, one to four tablets twice a day of risperidone. Patients who have any trouble tolerating the starting dose may have their dose reduced to 0.25 mg per day and continue in the study. Patients who cannot tolerate the 0.25 mg dosage would discontinue the study in order to receive alternative treatment.||Schedule of Events and Observations||Screening Visit: A Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis (SCID) in conjunction with DSM-IV criteria and a psychiatric history, will allow the study physicians to establish and confirm a diagnosis of Asperger's disorder. Medical history, vital signs, clinical labs {chemistry, complete blood count (CBC), thyroid function, urinalysis, urine drug screen, and blood pregnancy test (fecund females only)}, a physical exam, and an EKG will be performed to determine patient safety.||Blood Draws: Additional lab samples will be collected at both screening and end of study to explore 1) the effects of diet on treatment outcomes with risperidone, and 2) effects of risperidone treatment on levels of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Nerve Growth Factor (NGF). The additional blood will amount to an approximate total of 8 tablespoons of blood collected during the study.||MRS Visits and Practice Sessions: Subjects enrolling in the MRS arm, will be scheduled for a pretreatment MRS which will take place after the screening visit but before the baseline visit and prior to starting risperidone. Subjects will also have a post-treatment MRS within 7 days of their week 12 visit or at study termination. Patients will be supplied with enough medication to continue treatment until the MRS measures are complete.||Subjects may be required, based on the investigator's discretion, to complete one or two sessions during the screening period for Practice Sessions for MRS studies to better prepare subjects for the level of stillness needed for MRS studies. The practice sessions will last approximately one hour and will be performed at the Medical College of Georgia (MCG) Office of Clinical Investigative Services, located at 1521 Pope Ave, Suite FF-100. Practice Sessions may also be performed at the MRI suite at MCG to allow the subject to see or lie in the MRI machine, depending on availability.||Rationale for practice sessions: We have learned that these sessions may be necessary to help subjects achieve the stillness required for MRS. During the sessions, subjects will be trained to remain still while lying on a padded stretcher, using behavioral and relaxation training techniques performed by a qualified investigator. Other efforts will be made to simulate the MRS environment that may include playing recorded sounds of a MRI machine and simulation of the padded head supports.||In most cases the Practice Sessions, would be all done prior to the MRS visit, but in some cases of a failed MRS visit, the investigator may choose to schedule another practice session prior to re-trying the MRS visit. The practice session will supplement the standard efforts used to support patients' compliance during MRI procedures. For example, part of the hospital's usual care during MRI studies includes the option of having the patient wear video goggles and headphones. Subjects in our study may view a calming video of neutral content to aid in problems affecting stillness.||Behavioral reinforcement and subject payments during practice sessions. Part of the payment for practice sessions will be used as a behavioral reinforcement plan, and this will be in addition to the $20 payment for clinic visits, reimbursement for travel over 25 miles one-way @ .28/mile, and $50 for the MRS visit (paid regardless of success or failure).||The additional subject payment in the practice session will be used as incentive and behavioral reinforcement for achieving stillness. Specifically, subjects will receive a token (such as a poker chip or printed paper token) worth $5.00 for each 5-minute period they remain still. If a subject's head moves during a period, they will be told they have to begin a new period. The achievement of stillness will be determined by the investigator at the time, taking into account the actual observed stillness and the need to encourage and reward the subjects' efforts.||The actual stillness practice will last up to 40 minutes, and the subject will receive a token for each 5 minute period they remain still, for up to 8 periods. The total additional payment for behavioral reinforcement will range from $5.00 to $40.00, to be paid in the same way as other subject payments. In the case of adolescent subjects, parents will be encouraged to consider the additional practice session payments to go to the child as a reward for the child's efforts.||Baseline Visit: Subjects will be scheduled for baseline procedures when lab results and MRS values are reviewed and approved by the study physician, in most cases expected to be a period of 7 days. This visit will consist of medical-psychiatric interviews and neurocognitive testing. A urine pregnancy test (done previously at screening) may be repeated at baseline based on the judgement of the investigator.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Patients must be age 6 -18 for the Non-MRS arm of the study, and age 6 or above for the MRS arm of the study.|If applicable, a parent or legal guardian or legal representatives of study subject must provide informed consent and sign an informed consent document.|Female patients of childbearing age must be either postmenopausal for at least one year, surgically incapable of childbearing, or effectively practicing an acceptable method of contraception (oral or parenteral hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine device; barrier and spermicide.

They are also occasionally used for ADHD when more conventional treatments, such as psychostimulants and tricyclic antidepressants, have failed (Botteron & Geller, 1998). Despite a helpful role for the antipsychotic medications in many childhood conditions, there is a persistent although poorly substantiated impression that these medicines cause ""cognitive blunting"" in children. This may be more commonly heard than seen in print, but we believe that it is the cause of considerable resistance to antipsychotic treatment by physicians and nonmedical professionals alike.||At the same time, the data supporting the notion of cognitive blunting by antipsychotic medicines is largely negative (although limited in amount) and frequently badly out of date (see Ernst, Malone, Rowan, George, Gonzales, & Silva, 1998; Aman, 1984; Aman, Marks, Turbott, Wilsher, & Merry, 1991). There are good theoretical reasons to believe that novel antipsychotics may have no effects on cognition or may actually enhance cognitive functioning, at least in some disorders (Borison, 1996; Meltzer, 1995; Stip, 1996). At least one study thus far has shown significantly improved cognitive performance in schizophrenic patients taking risperidone as compared with such patients taking high-potency classical antipsychotics or no treatment (Gallhofer, Bauer, Lis, Krieger, & Gruppe, 1996).||Another source of resistance to the use of antipsychotic medicines with young people is the possibility that they may cause tardive dyskinesia. However, available data on the novel antipsychotics suggests that they are substantially safer than classical antipsychotics in this respect. Nevertheless, data are limited because of the newness of agents like risperidone.||Our laboratory at O.S.U. is unique because it has a sophisticated computer-controlled cognitive-motor test battery. O.S.U. is one of seven universities supported by NIMH as part of its network of Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology (""RUPPs""). Recently, Dr. Mike Aman reviewed the available cognitive test systems on behalf of the Autism RUPP Group. From this exercise, it became quite clear to us that we maintain what is probably the world's best system for assessing the cognitive-motor effects of psychotropic drugs in children, especially children with developmental handicaps.||The experimental (research) portion of the treatment is to assess the effects of risperidone (Risperdal) on learning performance and motor movements in children. This study is looking at whether or not risperidone improves performance on certain cognitive-motor tasks. It is also looking to detect any negative side effects that the medicine has on children's body movements. Risperidone is often used to treat children with disruptive behaviors.

Factors considered will include 1) psychiatric history; 2) symptom response; 3) psychosocial support; 4) measures of tolerability; 5) serum prolactin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor concentration; and 5) a variety of single nucleotide polymorphisms related to target genes for drug disposition and transport, response, and tolerability.

For children aged 8 years and above, the PedsQL items are scored on a 5 point Likert-type response scale (0=never a problem; 1=almost never a problem; 2=sometimes a problem; 3=often a problem; and 4=almost always a problem). For children aged 5-7 years, scoring is based on a three-point scale (0=Not at all, 2=Sometimes, 4=A lot). Once scored, items will be reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale (0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0), so that higher scores indicate better health-related quality of life.|The Vineland-II is an instrument that measures communication, daily living skills, socialization, motor skills (only in children up to 6 years) and maladaptive (not assessed in this study) behavior of individuals with developmental disabilities.

This debilitating disorder is estimated to occur in 2 to 10 of every 10,000 births. A primary focus in pyschopharmacological intervention has been to treat specific associated symptoms, such as hyperactivity, aggressiveness, and temper tantrums; there are few pharmacologic treatments directed toward core autistic symptoms.||Secretin is a gut hormone with binding sites in the brain. Previous research has described three patients with autism who underwent diagnostic endoscopy for gastrointestinal complaints and experienced dramatic improvement in autistic symptoms following the administration of intravenous secretin given as part of endoscopy. Though the results of this single, uncontrolled study have limited interpretive value, many autistic children have been exposed and continue to be exposed to this potential treatment in an uncontrolled manner. This double blind, placebo-controlled trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of secretin for the treatment of autism.||Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: synthetic porcine secretin (sPS), biologically derived porcine secretin (bPS), or placebo. Each participant will be given an initial intravenous dose of 0.1 ml of their assigned treatment at the appropriate dose (0.2 ug for sPS and 1 CU for bPS).

It was designed to assess handicapped and non-handicapped persons in their personal and social functioning and is appropriate for individuals of all ages. The Vineland-II is a survey that is administered to a parent or caregiver using a semi-structured interview format and is organized around four Behavior Domains: Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, and Motor Skills. Each subtest is scored with a standard score X=100 ± 15 and summed to calculate the Adaptive Behavior Composite (ABC) using age-adjusted scoring tables. Reported here are the ABC mean standard scores for the placebo and treatment groups at baseline. The ABC ranges from 20 to 160 and indicates low (20-70), moderately low (70-85), adequate (85-115), moderately high (115-130), or high (130-160) overall adaptive functioning.|The Vineland-II measures the personal and social skills of individuals from birth through adulthood.

The measure examines the child's attention, play, gestures, social communication, semantics, language structure, integrative language skills and emergent literacy skills. The PLS-5 has expanded coverage of early play behaviors, concepts, theory of mind, and emergent literacy skills. The PLS-5 yields norm-referenced scores including standard scores, percentile ranks and age equivalents for the AC and EC scales as well as for Total Language (TL). Raw score ranges are 0 to 65 in AC, 0 to 67 in EC, and therefore 0 to 132 in TL (calculated by summing AC+EC raw scores). The higher the scores, the greater the language ability.

The SPM-P provides norm-referenced standard scores for two higher-level integrative functions (praxis and social participation) and five sensor sensory systems (visual, auditory, tactile, proprioceptive, and vestibular functioning). Reported here is the Social Participation subscale mean raw score at baseline, which ranges from 8 to 32. The lower the raw score, the more limited the child's level of social participation.

The higher the score, the greater the child's level of social participation.|The Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale completed by a clinician that yields a rating of the patient's illness severity at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. The 7-point scale ranges from: 1 = Normal; 2 = Borderline Ill; 3 = Mildly Ill; 4 = Moderately Ill; 5 = Markedly Ill; 6 = Severely Ill; and 7 = Extremely Ill. Therefore, the higher the score, the greater the severity of the patient's illness. The CGI-S was administered at baseline only for the purpose of characterizing the study population. Shown here are the CGI-S mean scores from the baseline visit.|The Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) is a 7-point scale completed by a clinician that yields a score measuring the overall behavioral change of an individual and their therapeutic response. The 7-point scale ranges from: 1 = Very much improved; 2 = Much improved; 3 = Minimally improved; 4 = No change; 5 = Minimally worse; 6 = Much worse; and 7 = Very much worse. Therefore, the lower the score, the greater the behavioral improvement as rated by the clinician. The CGI-I was administered at the three-month and six-month visits.

Caregivers mark on a visual line measuring 10 cm with ""worst behavior"" at 0 cm and ""best behavior"" at 10 cm. For each behavior the caregiver is instructed to mark their impression of the behavior at baseline visit and again at the six-month visit. The calculated distance in cm between the marks drawn at the baseline and six-month visits thereby demonstrates whether each behavior improved, worsened, or stayed the same during the study, and by how much. Shown here is the mean distance in cm from the ""worst behavior"" side for the Language/Communication scale, at baseline. The smaller the value, the worse the behavior. The range is minimum 0 cm to maximum 10 cm.|The Visual Analog Scale measures the severity of three specific behavioral symptoms as reported by the parent/caregiver: Language/Communication, Anxiety/Obsessive Compulsive Behaviors, and Aggression/Hyperactivity/Hyperarousal.

These symptoms are associated with increased social deficits, depression, irritability, and stereotyped and self-injurious behaviors. Children and adolescents with anxiety also frequently avoid potentially stressful situations, thereby missing opportunities to learn important new skills. Despite the significant consequences of anxiety symptoms, several critical treatment-relevant issues remain unresolved. First, there is a lack of clarity about how to differentiate ASD and anxiety symptoms. Second, little is known about how anxiety manifests in those with ASD and intellectual disability (ID). Third, the neural substrates of anxiety in ASD are poorly understood. The overarching goal of this project is to investigate these open issues in order to make interventions more precise, more personalized, and more likely to promote positive outcomes -- an objective consistent with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Roadmap, Precision Medicine, and Research Domain Criteria Project (RDoC) Initiatives and the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) Strategic Plan, Chapter 4.||While there is no doubt that anxiety is a very serious issue for those with ASD, what to do about this problem is less clear. The search for empirically-validated treatments has begun with multiple small trials providing promising evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) might reduce anxiety in those with ASD. However, this work is in its early stages. There is a great need for large, rigorously designed trials that validate the effectiveness of both medication and CBT, as well as functional neuroimaging studies that identify neural predictors of treatment efficacy and markers of therapy-induced change. Such work holds the potential to help answer the questions posed above and to assist the field in developing more personalized treatments. In Project 1 of the Center for the Development of Phenotype-Based Treatments of Autism Spectrum Disorder, we will conduct a study in children with ASD and clinically significant anxiety ages 8-14 to compare efficacy of these different treatment types.||The overall aims of the study are to better characterize the sub-group of children and preadolescents with ASD that exhibit clinically significant anxiety and fears through a 16-week randomized comparative treatment trial of Behavioral Intervention for Anxiety in Children with Autism (BIACA), sertraline, and placebo in youth with ASD, IQ>50, and clinically significant anxiety as assessed by a PARS score that is greater than or equal to 8. Clinician-administered gold standard assays will be used of traditional DSM (Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale [PARS] and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-IV [ADIS-IV]), and nontraditional ASD related anxiety symptoms (Autism Spectrum Addendum to the ADIS [ASDD]), as well as parent reports of potentially overlapping symptoms that complicate the ASD anxiety phenotype.

The researchers are investigating the use of this selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in FXS because a retrospective study has shown significant improvements in language and decreases in autistic behavior. There is also emerging evidence regarding the stimulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the stimulation of neurogenesis when an SSRI is given early on in the development of animal models of Down syndrome.

The test has five scales: gross motor, visual reception, fine motor, receptive language, and expressive language. Shown here are the baseline and 6-month follow-up raw scores from the expressive language scale. This scale's raw scores range from 0 to 50. The lower the score on this scale, the weaker the ability; the higher the score, the greater the ability. The MSEL was administered at the baseline visit and at the 6-month follow-up visit.|The Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) is used to measure the overall behavioral change of an individual and their therapeutic response. The CGI-I is a 3-item observer-rated scale administered by the physician to the caregiver, who assesses improvement using a 7-point scale: 1 = Very much improved; 2 = Much improved; 3 = Minimally improved; 4 = No change; 5 = Minimally worse; 6 = Much worse; and 7 = Very much worse. Therefore, the lower the score, the greater the behavioral improvement as rated by the caregiver. Shown here are the CGI-I mean scores from the 6-month follow-up visit.|The Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) is a cognitive test to measure cognitive ability and language development. The test has five scales: gross motor, visual reception, fine motor, receptive language and expressive language. Based on the raw score obtained by the participant in each scale the scoring software computes T scores, percentile ranks, and age equivalents for each scale separately. Shown here are the baseline and 6-month follow-up T scores from the expressive language scale. T scores have a range of 20 to 80, a mean of 50, and a standard deviation of 10. Any child scoring at or below 1.5 standard deviations below the average is considered presenting significant delays. The lower the T score, the worse the outcome. The MSEL was administered at the baseline visit and at the 6-month follow-up visit.|The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2) assesses and diagnoses autism spectrum disorder. This test was administered at baseline and at the six-month follow-up visit. The choice to administer Module 1 or Module 2 depends on the verbal ability of each subject: Module 1 is used for children who are 31 months and older and/or who do not consistently use phrase speech, and Module 2 is used for children of any age who use phrase speech but are not verbally fluent. The scoring algorithm gives an overall total, which ranges from 0 to 28. The higher the score, the higher the level of autism-related symptoms. The overall total ranges from 0 to 28. On Module 1, for children with few to no words, scores at 11 and above indicate autism spectrum; for children with some words, the cutoff is scores 8 and above. On Module 2, the cutoff for autism spectrum is 7 or above for kids under 5 years, and 8 or above for those 5 years and older.|The Visual Analog Scale will be used to measure the severity of three specific behavioral symptoms chosen by the caregiver(s). Parents mark on a visual line measuring 10 cm with ""worst behavior"" at 0 cm and ""best behavior"" at 10 cm. The parents choose two key behaviors that they want to target for this trial (e.g., aggression, hyperarousal, anxiety, hyperactivity) and the third target measurement is language/communication. For each behavior the caregiver is instructed to mark their impression of the behavior at baseline visit and again at the 6-month visit. The calculated distance in cm between the baseline and 6-month visit marks thereby demonstrates whether each behavior improved, worsened, or stayed the same during the study, and by how much. Shown here is the mean distance in cm from the ""worst behavior"" side, at baseline. The smaller the value, the worse the behavior. The range is minimum 0 cm to maximum 10 cm.|There are several eye tracking measures, each intended to measure different outcomes including social gaze, social reciprocity, and attention. All stimuli are presented on a Tobii T120 binocular eye tracker monitor. The system consists of a high-resolution camera embedded in a 17-inch TFT monitor. Stimuli consist of sixty colored photographs of adult human face (equal numbers of males and females, different races and ethnicities) from the NimStim Face Stimulus Set, each showing a calm, happy, or fearful expression, and sixty scrambled versions of the face images. Shown here are the averaged response times (in seconds) to the presented stimuli, at the baseline visit.|The Preschool Language Scale-fifth edition (PLS-5) is designed to measure auditory comprehension (AC) and expressive communication (EC) for children birth to 7 years 11 months. The measure examines the child's attention, play, gestures, social communication, semantics, language structure, integrative language skills and emergent literacy skills. The PLS-5 has expanded coverage of early play behaviors, concepts, Theory of Mind, as well as emergent literacy skills. The PLS-5 yields norm-referenced scores including standard scores, percentile ranks and age equivalents for the AC and EC scales as well as for Total Language (TL). Raw score ranges are 0 to 65 in AC, 0 to 67 in EC, and therefore 0 to 132 in TL (calculated by summing AC+EC raw scores). The higher the scores, the greater the language ability. Shown here are the mean TL raw scores from the baseline visit.|The Sensory Processing Measure - Preschool (SPM-P) is a questionnaire that was used to measure specific problems, including under- and over-responsiveness, sensory-seeking behavior, and perceptual problems in multiple environments (at home, at school, and in the community) for children aged 2 to 5 years old. The SPM-P provides norm-referenced standard scores for two higher level integrative functions (praxis and social participation) and five sensor sensory systems (visual, auditory, tactile, proprioceptive, and vestibular functioning). Reported here is the Social Participation subscale mean raw score, which ranges from 8 to 32. The lower the raw score, the more limited the child's level of social participation. The higher the score, the greater the child's level of social participation.|The Sensory Profile is designed to measure sensory-related difficulties. This measure will be administered to the primary caregiver of each subject to measure the caregiver's sensory ability and its impact on the subject. Of the four subscales scored in the Sensory Profile, the ""Sensation Seeking"" subscale mean raw scores for the placebo and treatment groups are reported here. This subscale has a raw scores range from 0 to 95, with scores 0-6 indicating that the child is sensation seeking much less than others, 7-19 less than others, 20-47 just like the majority of others, 48-60 more than others, and 61-95 much more than others.|The Vineland-II measures the personal and social skills of individuals from birth through adulthood. It was designed to assess handicapped and non-handicapped persons in their personal and social functioning and is appropriate for individuals of all ages. The Vineland-II is a survey that is administered to a parent or caregiver using a semi-structured interview format and is organized around four Behavior Domains: Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, and Motor Skills. Each subtest is scored with a standard score X=100 ± 15 and summed to calculate the Adaptive Behavior Composite (ABC) using age-adjusted scoring tables. Reported here are the ABC mean standard scores for the placebo and treatment groups baseline. The ABC ranges from 20 to 160 and indicates low (20-70), moderately low (70-85), adequate (85-115), moderately high (115-130), or high (130-160) overall adaptive functioning.|The Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) is a cognitive test to measure cognitive ability and language development.

This test was administered at baseline and at the six-month follow-up visit. The choice to administer Module 1 or Module 2 depends on the verbal ability of each subject: Module 1 is used for children who are 31 months and older and/or who do not consistently use phrase speech, and Module 2 is used for children of any age who use phrase speech but are not verbally fluent. The scoring algorithm gives an overall total, which ranges from 0 to 28. The higher the score, the higher the level of autism-related symptoms. The overall total ranges from 0 to 28. On Module 1, for children with few to no words, scores at 11 and above indicate autism spectrum; for children with some words, the cutoff is scores 8 and above. On Module 2, the cutoff for autism spectrum is 7 or above for kids under 5 years, and 8 or above for those 5 years and older.|The Visual Analog Scale will be used to measure the severity of three specific behavioral symptoms chosen by the caregiver(s). Parents mark on a visual line measuring 10 cm with ""worst behavior"" at 0 cm and ""best behavior"" at 10 cm. The parents choose two key behaviors that they want to target for this trial (e.g., aggression, hyperarousal, anxiety, hyperactivity) and the third target measurement is language/communication. For each behavior the caregiver is instructed to mark their impression of the behavior at baseline visit and again at the 6-month visit. The calculated distance in cm between the baseline and 6-month visit marks thereby demonstrates whether each behavior improved, worsened, or stayed the same during the study, and by how much. Shown here is the mean distance in cm from the ""worst behavior"" side, at baseline. The smaller the value, the worse the behavior. The range is minimum 0 cm to maximum 10 cm.|There are several eye tracking measures, each intended to measure different outcomes including social gaze, social reciprocity, and attention. All stimuli are presented on a Tobii T120 binocular eye tracker monitor. The system consists of a high-resolution camera embedded in a 17-inch TFT monitor. Stimuli consist of sixty colored photographs of adult human face (equal numbers of males and females, different races and ethnicities) from the NimStim Face Stimulus Set, each showing a calm, happy, or fearful expression, and sixty scrambled versions of the face images. Shown here are the averaged response times (in seconds) to the presented stimuli, at the baseline visit.|The Preschool Language Scale-fifth edition (PLS-5) is designed to measure auditory comprehension (AC) and expressive communication (EC) for children birth to 7 years 11 months. The measure examines the child's attention, play, gestures, social communication, semantics, language structure, integrative language skills and emergent literacy skills. The PLS-5 has expanded coverage of early play behaviors, concepts, Theory of Mind, as well as emergent literacy skills. The PLS-5 yields norm-referenced scores including standard scores, percentile ranks and age equivalents for the AC and EC scales as well as for Total Language (TL). Raw score ranges are 0 to 65 in AC, 0 to 67 in EC, and therefore 0 to 132 in TL (calculated by summing AC+EC raw scores). The higher the scores, the greater the language ability. Shown here are the mean TL raw scores from the baseline visit.|The Sensory Processing Measure - Preschool (SPM-P) is a questionnaire that was used to measure specific problems, including under- and over-responsiveness, sensory-seeking behavior, and perceptual problems in multiple environments (at home, at school, and in the community) for children aged 2 to 5 years old. The SPM-P provides norm-referenced standard scores for two higher level integrative functions (praxis and social participation) and five sensor sensory systems (visual, auditory, tactile, proprioceptive, and vestibular functioning). Reported here is the Social Participation subscale mean raw score, which ranges from 8 to 32. The lower the raw score, the more limited the child's level of social participation. The higher the score, the greater the child's level of social participation.|The Sensory Profile is designed to measure sensory-related difficulties. This measure will be administered to the primary caregiver of each subject to measure the caregiver's sensory ability and its impact on the subject.

The present study will employ an ABA design in which three pediatric participants will be selected to receive baseline medical, developmental, behavioral, and cognitive evaluations, followed by a 26 week administration of sirolimus, repeated baseline assessments at the end of the 26 week treatment phase, and a 4 week titrated withdrawal followed by a 22 week period in which no rapalogue is administered. All participants will again be administered baseline medical, behavioral, and cognitive evaluations at the end of the study in order to compare all evaluations done at baseline, the end of the 26 week treatment, and completion of the study. These comparisons will be done to assess secondary outcomes that include reductions in autistic symptoms, self-injury, and aggression, as well as improvements in cognitive function across multiple domains. Furthermore, administration of the secondary outcome measures will also allow us to better understand the sensitivity of these measures in patients with TSC during the course of a clinical trial.||Families of potentially eligible children who express interest in the study and meet prescreening criteria will be invited to attend a screening visit to determine eligibility, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and availability for eight additional study visits. Prior to enrollment, informed consent will be obtained from the parent or legal guardian.||Investigators will use the methods of analysis of single-subject research (ABA design, where first A represents baseline, B represents treatment, and A represents reversal of treatment. The analysis will focus on each of the 3 subjects separately. Data on feasibility and safety (primary outcome) and on frequency of disruptive behavior (secondary outcome) will be plotted and visually inspected to detect any temporal changes by phase: 1.

These changes have been recorded in 38% of autistic children in a clinical survey and 83% in an observational study, respectively. The cellular basis for this ""fever effect"" is unknown but is likely to involve heat shock proteins (HSP) and cellular stress responses (CSR) that lead to changes in synaptic function and network connectivity.||Sulforaphane (1-isothiocyanato-4R- (methylsulfinyl)butane) is an isothiocyanate that is delivered by lyophilized extracts of 3-day-old broccoli sprouts. Broccoli sprouts are widely consumed as a food item all over the world by very large numbers of individuals, without any reports of adverse effects. Our preliminary work in vitro shows that sulforaphane stimulates HSP and mitochondrial biogenesis in several genetic disorders.||This study of sulforaphane-rich Broccoli Sprout Extract in autism is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase II single site trial, designed to ensure safety and obtain efficacy data, with a focus on changes in social responsiveness, a core feature of autism. Its hybrid design, incorporating double masking, placebo control, and randomization, enhances the robustness of early outcome data. The study duration will be 2 years. Recruitment of subjects will be 50% by 8 months and complete by 14 months. All subjects in the study will be followed for 22 weeks. Treatment (18 weeks) will be started as patients are entered into the study and receive baseline testing. All treatment will be completed by 20 months and data analysis and presentation of results by 24 months.||Forty-five male adolescents (13-18 years) and adults (19-30 years) with autism will be randomly assigned to receive either sulforaphane-rich Broccoli Sprout Extract (n = 30) or placebo (n = 15). The 2:1 randomization schedule will be produced by the study statistician using permuted random blocks and stratification by history of positive behavioral effects of fever. Treatment assignments will be performed by the research pharmacy at MGH. Females will be excluded for homogeneity of the sample and because males have higher incidence of autism than females (4:1). We will seek to enroll up to 50% of the subjects having a history of positive behavioral effects of fever, which will be recorded from caregivers' recall of incidents and graded on the CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) 7-point scale.||There will be in total 7 study visits for each subject: the screening visit, enrollment visit, a blood draw visit at 24 hours after the first dose of study medication (for mitochondrial/heat shock protein analysis), 4 week (follow-up) visit, 10 week (follow-up) visit, 18 week visit (last treatment visit), and the final closeout visit one month after the study drug stops (22 weeks). Even though the treatment will stop at 18 weeks, we will follow subjects for additional 4 weeks after study medication stops (the 22 week visit) to ensure safety after study drug stops.

The data for pharmacologic treatment of repetitive behaviours in this disorder has also become difficult to interpret given that the last two large multisite trials of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in autism are reported to be negative for the treatment of repetitive behaviours. Only the associated symptom of irritability has 2 drugs with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications, whereas no systematic data exists on the pharmacologic treatment of anxiety in ASD, and response rates to stimulants for hyperactivity are lower than what is seen in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In addition, there are no biological markers of treatment response identified in this population at this point.

These children present a challenge to successful EEG execution, due to a lack of co-operation, and thus, are often in need of sedation. Historically we have used orally administered, Triclofos Sodium (TFS) - pharmacologically and physiologically similar to chloral hydrate, for sedation in this age group. However success using this drug is limited to approximately 75% in those aged 5 years and above, and possibly lower in this age group when associated with a diagnosis of ASD. The medication is often poorly tolerated by the oral route, and involves patient agitation, spiting (with incomplete drug ingestion), and immediate vomiting upon administration. Recently we have introduced Intra-nasal Dexmedetomidine (IN DEX), with an initial impression of much improved drug acceptance and possibly improved efficacy over TFS.||We designed this pilot study, with the aim of comparing efficacy, tolerance of drug administration and adverse events between TFS and IN DEX, with the goal of generating initial results as well as feasibility of recruitment for a larger trial.",Intranasal Dexmedetomidine vs Oral Triclofos Sodium for EEG in Children With Autism,,,1-Aug-22,Anticipated,Autistic Disorder,Autistic Disorder,D000001321,Autistic Disorder,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Double,,Supportive Care,Care Provider|Outcomes Assessor,"Study participants will be allocated, amongst patients invited for routine EEG monitoring in the hospitals EEG facility.

Difficulty with social interactions is characteristic of people with autism, who often have problems interpreting facial expressions or maintaining eye contact while talking with someone. There are currently no effective medicines available to treat social problems in individuals with autism. Neuropeptides, such as vasopressin and oxytocin, are molecules used by neurons in the brain to communicate with one another. Vasopressin is closely related to oxytocin, which is currently being tested as a treatment for autism, and has been shown to enhance social functioning in animals. Animal studies have shown that when the proper functioning of vasopressin is experimentally altered, animals develop a variety of social deficits, including impaired memory for peers and a reduced interest in social interaction. Researchers found that when vasopressin was administered to mice with a genetically induced form of autism, their social functioning improved. Vasopressin is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in humans, and has proved to be a successful treatment for some common pediatric conditions, including bedwetting. Similar to oxytocin, it also has been shown to improve social cognition and memory in people who do not have autism. The researchers will test the effects of vasopressin on social impairments in 50 boys and girls with autism, ages 6 to 12 years old. The study will last four weeks for each participant. Participants will receive either vasopressin or a placebo nasal spray.

The Centers for Disease Control estimates that ASD affects as many as 17 per 1000 children (1 in 59) in the United States suggesting that the prevalence is higher than previous estimates.Despite the dramatic rise in the detected prevalence of ASD over the past two decades, there is no effective medical treatment for core ASD symptoms (social communication and repetitive behavior), the closely associated problem of language impairment, or the underlying pathophysiology of ASD. Currently, the only accepted treatment for core ASD symptoms is behavior therapy, which may entail intensive one-on-one treatment over several years.||The primary aims of this study are to evaluate the effect of a wide-spectrum nutritional supplement on mitochondrial function in individuals with ASD. Participants entered into the trial will have abnormalities in mitochondrial function that are known to be associated with ASD (approximately 50+% of children with ASD) but are not diagnostic of mitochondrial disease. The investigators hypothesize that nutritional supplements designed for children with ASD have a physiological action of normalizing mitochondrial function and cellular physiology throughout the body.||To test whether the targeted nutritional supplement is superior to placebo, the investigators will study 50 children, between the ages of 4 years to 14 years, with confirmed ASD and known abnormal variations in mitochondrial at baseline. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive active treatment or placebo for 12-weeks under double-blind conditions and at the end of the 12 weeks switch to the opposite condition after a 2-week wash out period. Mitochondrial function will be measured at baseline and after each treatment arm in order to determine if the supplement positively influences cellular biochemistry.

SPECIFIC AIMS||To investigate the safety of clinical use of ziprasidone in children|To investigate the dosages that have been employed clinically.||II. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE||Ziprasidone, a recently released atypical agent is likely to be as effective as other neuroleptics in treating psychiatric symptoms in children, but may have the considerable health advantage of not causing weight gain. Ziprasidone administration has been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval (mean=20 msec), an electrocardiographic measure of ventricular repolarization (Federal Drug Administration, 2000). There are no reports regarding the use of ziprasidone in autism, and data regarding the safety and efficacy of ziprasidone in children is extremely limited. The only published study of ziprasidone in children found that it was safe and effective in treating Tourette's syndrome in children aged 7 to 17 years of age (Sallee et al, 2000). Because children are being treated with ziprasidone despite a paucity of safety data, it is important to begin to collect and review available data, including that from clinical usage. Some children who receive services within the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Services of Drexel University College of Medicine have been treated with ziprasidone. The charts of the children and adolescents will contain data regarding exposure to ziprasidone and laboratory data and ECG's that can be reviewed to determine whether ziprasidone treatment has been associated with changes in weight, laboratory values and ECG's. We propose to review the charts of patients who have been treated with our services since March 1, 2001 XXX because such patients may have been exposed to ziprasidone (ziprasidone received FDA approval on February 5, 2001).||III. DESIGN AND METHODS||A. Setting: The setting for this study will be the Specialty Clinic for Pervasive Developmental Disorders, part of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic at Eastern Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute.||B. Subjects: Subjects will be 15 children and adolescents who meet the DSM-IV Criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorder.||C. Design: This is a 6-week pilot study employing open treatment with ziprasidone. Subjects will be rated at baseline and thereafter assessed weekly.||D. Medication: Subjects will be treated openly with ziprasidone. Should untoward effects occur, the dosage of the medication will be reduced or the medication will be discontinued, as clinically appropriate. Subjects will not receive other concomitant psychotropic medication during the study. Medication will be taken concomitant with food.||Ziprasidone Dosing Strategy: Ziprasidone tablets (5, 10, and 20 mg) will be employed for the study. The dosage range for ziprasidone will be 5 mg/day to 40 mg/day. Every effort will be made to reach and maintain a therapeutic dosage by week four of the treatment phase.||For subjects who weigh less than 25 kg, starting dosage will be 5 mg/every other day. After 3 days, the dosage can be increased to 5 mg. By week 2, subjects can be increased to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 20 mg increments weekly.|For subjects who weigh greater than 25 kg, the starting dosage will be 5 mg/day. After three days, the dosage can be increased to 10 mg/day. By week two, subjects can be increased to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 20 mg increments weekly as needed.||Note: Should 5 mg tablets not be available, the dosing schedule will be altered to have a starting dosage of 10 mg, and dosage increases will be made in 10 mg increments.||F. Measures||Primary efficacy measure: The Clinical Global Impressions (CGI; Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The efficacy of treatments can be judged on their ability to enhance global functioning, an assessment that is particularly relative in a pilot study. The CGI consists of three global scales measuring severity of illness, global improvement, and drug effect, and has been useful in measuring drug treatment effect in this population (see Campbell and Palij, 1985). The PI and another trained rater will complete this scale. Although only members of the research team generally complete this scale, it will additionally be completed by the subject's parent/caretaker. Having it completed by the parent/caretaker will take only minutes and may result in useful data. This measure will be completed weekly beginning at baseline.|Secondary efficacy measure: Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale (Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The CPRS was developed by the Psychopharmacology Branch of the NIMH to rate childhood psychopathology. Each of the items is rated from ""1"" (not present) to ""7"" (extremely severe). The first 28 items of this scale require no verbal response on the part of the subject, making them appropriate for rating children and adolescents with Pervasive Developmental Disorder. Of these 28 items, 14 are particularly relevant in autism (see Campbell and Palij, 1985): they assess the symptoms for which drug treatment is indicated including hyperactivity, aggression, self-abusive behavior, temper tantrums, lability of mood, irritability, social withdrawal, and stereotypies. A composite sum of these 14 items, the CPRS-14, will be constructed and employed as a secondary outcome measure, a procedure used by a number of investigators (Anderson et al, 1989; Campbell et al, 1986, 1989, 1993; Findling et al, 1997; Sanchez et al, 1996). We analyzed our data using the CPRS-14; the ICC was 0.8978. In addition, 4 factors derived from these 14 items will be examined. They include: autism, anger/uncooperativeness, hyperactivity, and speech deviance (Overall and Campbell, 1988). This measure will be completed at baseline and at the end of treatment.|Safety measures: (1) A physical exam will be completed at baseline. (2) Height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse will be obtained and recorded at baseline and at each visit during the study. (3) The following laboratory measures will be obtained at baseline and repeated at the end of the treatment phase: complete blood count with differential, liver functions, and electrocardiogram. Serum prolactin will be obtained at baseline and at the end of the treatment phase. These laboratory studies will be repeated at the end of the treatment phase of the study. Any other clinically appropriate tests and evaluations will also be completed whenever needed.||Untoward effects will be measured and recorded at each visit employing the following measures: (1) Dosage Record and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (DOTES); (2) Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale (TESS); (3) Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) (all from Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985); and (4) the Neurologic Rating Scale (Simpson and Angus, 1970). The DOTES and TESS measure a wide range of possible untoward effects. The AIMS measures dyskinesias. The Neurologic Rating Scale measures other forms of extrapyramidal effects that can occur with neuroleptics such as dystonias, parkinsonian effects, and akathisia.||G. Procedures: All patients appropriate to the study and their parent/caretakers will be approached and informed consent and assent (in subjects under 14 years) will be obtained. Subjects meeting the Inclusion Criteria, but not the Exclusion Criteria, will enter the baseline period of the study.||Baseline (week 0): Subjects will be rated at baseline employing the CGI and the CPRS.||End of Treatment (week 6): At the end of the treatment period, subjects will again be rated employing the CGI and the CPRS (selected items).||In addition, each subject will be rated on the CGI at each visit so that data from the last visit is available should the subject terminate the study prematurely. If it is known that a subject will terminate the study at a visit before week 6, the subject will be rated with the CGI and the CPRS at that visit.||All safety measures will be completed at each visit. Laboratory measures and EKG will be obtained in the morning.||I. Analysis: This is a pilot study whose purpose is to get initial safety and efficacy data with ziprasidone in children with autism. We will perform an ANOVA, repeated measures, for CGI severity scores, the CPRS-14 and the CPRS factors. Similar analyses will be performed for safety measures including for weight, prolactin and other laboratory measures, and EKG indices.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Diagnosis of autism (DSM-IV) made by a boarded child and adolescent psychiatrist.|Males and females.|Aged 12 to 18 years.|Clinical judgment that medication treatment for autism is indicated.||Exclusion Criteria:||Major medical problems including cardiac, liver, endocrine, or renal diseases.|History of seizure disorder or gross neurological deficit.|Baseline QTC greater than 425 msec.|Concomitant treatment with psychotropic medication.|History of prior exposure to ziprasidone.",15,Actual,,,,,,All,No,,1 Open Label,"Ziprasidone 40mg to 60mg per day, individually titrated",Ziprasidone,Geodon,Drug,,,17-Jun-10,Estimate,15-Jun-10,OTHER,Drexel University College of Medicine,Philadelphia,,,United States,Drexel University College of Medicine at Friends Hospital,Pennsylvania,,18 Years,12 Years,Ziprasidone in Children With Autism: A Pilot Study,OTHER,Drexel University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Drexel University College of Medicine,Completed,Yes,Phase 2,5-Jun,Actual,,Clinical Global Impressions,Week 6,,,,,,,,,,,,Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale,"Baseline, Week 6",,,,,,,2-Feb,,10-Jun,Child|Adult,21-Sep-05,Estimate,13-Sep-05,13-Sep-05,,Interventional,15-Oct-21,,No
