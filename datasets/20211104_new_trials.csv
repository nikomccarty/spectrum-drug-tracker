This disorder is characterized by the development of benign tumors in multiple organ systems, including the brain. The primary neurological manifestations of TSC are epilepsy, mental retardation and autism. Epilepsy is most common, occurring in 80-90% of patients, and often the seizures are severe, unremitting, and uncontrolled by current anticonvulsant medications. It is generally accepted that the seizures arise from cortical and subcortical tubers and surrounding tissue in the brain. These tubers are caused by mutations in the tumor suppressor genes TSC1 or TSC2. The protein products of these genes, hamartin and tuberin, act as negative regulators of the PI3K/PKB(Akt)/mTOR signaling pathway that regulates cell growth and proliferation Everolimus is an immunosuppressant drug that also inhibits mTOR signaling and is capable of reversing aberrant mTOR-dependent effects that occur when hamartin or tuberin are absent or defective.

AS is caused by a missing or incomplete chromosome 15 that is inherited from the mother. Diagnosis of AS is usually made between three and seven years of age, when the characteristic behaviors and features of the disease become most evident. Prior to AS diagnosis, the symptoms may be mistaken for cerebral palsy or autism. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy, communication skills development, and behavior modification help to improve the quality of life of these children, but other treatments are needed.||In a previous study, decreased DNA methylation, which is a type of chemical change in DNA, was observed in an individual with AS; this condition may be a primary cause of AS. It is hypothesized that promoting increased DNA methylation might reduce the severity of AS symptoms. Betaine, creatine, Metafolin, and vitamin B12 are compounds normally found in the body that are involved in the DNA methylation pathway. Increasing the concentrations of these compounds in the body may enhance DNA methylation. This study will evaluate the efficacy of four dietary supplements in treating the symptoms of AS.||This study will last 12 months. Study visits will occur at study entry and Month 12. A selected group of participants, those who meet the diagnostic criteria for autism, will also be evaluated at Month 6. At study visits, participants will undergo an electroencephalogram (EEG). Medical history, physical exam, neurological exams, and developmental assessments will also be performed. Urine and blood collection, including tests to determine the blood levels of the dietary supplements, will occur at study entry and Months 6 and 12. Participants will receive two daily doses of Metafolin, betaine, and creatine, and one daily dose of vitamin B12 for the duration of the study. Parents will be asked to complete a questionnaire at each visit to report their child's behavior while taking the dietary supplements.

There is one test statistic (z-score) per analyte, reflecting the pre-post comparison across all subjects.||Pre and post treatment measurements of csf analytes: TNF alpha, Il-6, CCL-2(MCP-1), CCL3 (MIP-1alpha), CCL5(RANTES), CXCL(IL-8), BDNF, CD40L, GDNF, HGF, Leptin",z Score,Pre and post treatment with minocyline at 6 months for 10 subjects,"Auld DS, Robitaille R.

1121,121,1122,,,,,,"This study is designed to determine the effectiveness of risperidone, a drug treatment for the interfering symptoms of Autistic Disorder in children and adolescents between the ages of 5 and 17. Between 100 and 120 patients will be participating in this research study at five academic medical centers in the United States. The primary aim of the treatment is to reduce impairing behavioral symptoms such as aggression, explosive outbursts, or self-injurious behavior, without significant side effects. A secondary aim is to evaluate possible improvement in the level of social relatedness, attention, motor coordination, and short-term memory.||This study is a placebo-controlled, double-blind study (neither the investigators nor patients know if the treatment being given is risperidone or an inactive substance, placebo). Patients will be asked to participate for 6 to 8 months. For the first 8 weeks, patients will receive either risperidone or placebo, randomly chosen. At the end of the 8 weeks, those patients who have improved and were on risperidone will be asked to continue on this medication for another 4 months. The last two months of the study are again double-blind (neither patients nor investigators know treatment). Patients will either continue risperidone treatment or be gradually tapered from risperidone (placebo-substitution). This blinded discontinuation phase will last 2 months during which patients will be closely monitored for recurrence or worsening of symptoms. Patients who have been treated with placebo in the first 8 weeks of the study and have not improved will be treated with risperidone. Weekly visits are required for the first 8 weeks of the study, monthly visits for the following 4 months, and weekly visits during the last 2 months of the study.",Treatment of Autism in Children and Adolescents,,,,February 2001,,Autistic Disorder,Autistic Disorder,D000001321,Autistic Disorder,Randomized,,Double,,1122,Treatment,,,Eligible patients will undergo comprehensive evaluation.

It is characterized by social and language deficits and repetitive behaviors/restricted interests. Functional imaging is becoming a very useful tool in trying to understand the neurobiology of autism. Oxytocin is a hormone produced by the brain to assist with labor and lactation. Recent evidence suggests that it may be involved in social attachment and in repetitive behaviors. In this project, we will study how oxytocin changes the way the brain of autistic adults processes faces, and deals with response inhibition (the ability to interrupt ongoing responses should they prove ineffective or interfering with attaining a goal). There is currently no functional imaging data assessing the effect of oxytocin on the brain. We will explore the activation patterns in response to oxytocin across circuits involved in social cognition (face fusiform area) and response inhibition (caudate, orbitofrontal and dorsolateral cortex) by administering a specific fMRI task activating those circuits before and during an oxytocin infusion. We will also explore the effect of oxytocin in these areas by administering specific cognitive testing not associated with fMRI before and during oxytocin infusion.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Meet DSM-IV, ADI, or ADOS criteria for autism spectrum disorder.|Age 18-50.|Be seen as outpatients|IQ>80|5.
