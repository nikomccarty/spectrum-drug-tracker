The Centers for Disease Control estimates that ASD affects as many as 14.7 per 1000 children (1 in 68). Despite the dramatic rise in the detected prevalence of ASD over the past two decades, no effective medical treatment has been developed to address core ASD symptoms (social communication and repetitive behavior), the closely associated problem of language impairment, or the underlying pathophysiology of ASD. Currently, the only accepted treatment for core ASD symptoms is behavior therapy, which may entail intensive one-on-one treatment over several years.||The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of folinic acid in the treatment of language problems in children with autism spectrum disorder. Folinic acid, also known as leucovorin, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to decrease side effects during cancer chemotherapy.

Improvement in delayed language may also benefit the core ASD problem of social communication. The study will also focus on identification of biomarkers in pre-specified subgroups of children with ASD that may moderate positive response to folinic acid. The study model is that high-dose folinic acid will improve language and set the stage for improved social communication in children with ASD and moderate language impairment.

Individuals with ASD often have behavioral issues and psychiatric comorbidities which can be very hard to manage. Currently, there are only two FDA approved medications (aripiprazole and risperidone) for the treatment of irritability in ASD. Both medications have the potential for side effects and are not tolerated in all children with ASD. Anecdotal and some preliminary studies suggest that cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid in the marijuana plant, may lead to improvements in symptoms of ASD including irritability, aggressive behaviors, and anxiety.||In this study the investigators will test whether CBD leads to differences in behaviors commonly associated with ASD. The main behavioral problems investigators will study are irritability and aggressive behavior. This study will also measure changes in other behaviors seen in ASD such as anxiety, social interaction difficulties, repetitive behaviors, attentional problems, hyperactivity, repetitive behaviors, and quality of life. Study investigators will also test whether there are any important side effects of CBD in children and adolescents with ASD.","Inclusion Criteria:||Male or female children and adolescents aged 5-17 years, inclusive, at the time of screening.|Judged by the investigator to be in good health at screening based upon the results of a medical history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory test results.|Patients must have a previous documented diagnosis of ASD by a medical or psychological professional.|Patients must be assessed by the Investigator as being moderately to severely impacted due to ASD|Patients who are taking psychotropic medication(s) should be on a stable regimen of no more than 2 medications for at least 4 weeks preceding study Screening and must maintain that regimen throughout the study.

These symptoms are associated with increased social deficits, depression, irritability, and stereotyped and self-injurious behaviors. Children and adolescents with anxiety also frequently avoid potentially stressful situations, thereby missing opportunities to learn important new skills. Despite the significant consequences of anxiety symptoms, several critical treatment-relevant issues remain unresolved. First, there is a lack of clarity about how to differentiate ASD and anxiety symptoms. Second, little is known about how anxiety manifests in those with ASD and intellectual disability (ID). Third, the neural substrates of anxiety in ASD are poorly understood. The overarching goal of this project is to investigate these open issues in order to make interventions more precise, more personalized, and more likely to promote positive outcomes -- an objective consistent with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Roadmap, Precision Medicine, and Research Domain Criteria Project (RDoC) Initiatives and the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) Strategic Plan, Chapter 4.||While there is no doubt that anxiety is a very serious issue for those with ASD, what to do about this problem is less clear. The search for empirically-validated treatments has begun with multiple small trials providing promising evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) might reduce anxiety in those with ASD. However, this work is in its early stages. There is a great need for large, rigorously designed trials that validate the effectiveness of both medication and CBT, as well as functional neuroimaging studies that identify neural predictors of treatment efficacy and markers of therapy-induced change. Such work holds the potential to help answer the questions posed above and to assist the field in developing more personalized treatments. In Project 1 of the Center for the Development of Phenotype-Based Treatments of Autism Spectrum Disorder, we will conduct a study in children with ASD and clinically significant anxiety ages 8-14 to compare efficacy of these different treatment types.||The overall aims of the study are to better characterize the sub-group of children and preadolescents with ASD that exhibit clinically significant anxiety and fears through a 16-week randomized comparative treatment trial of Behavioral Intervention for Anxiety in Children with Autism (BIACA), sertraline, and placebo in youth with ASD, IQ>50, and clinically significant anxiety as assessed by a PARS score that is greater than or equal to 8. Clinician-administered gold standard assays will be used of traditional DSM (Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale [PARS] and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-IV [ADIS-IV]), and nontraditional ASD related anxiety symptoms (Autism Spectrum Addendum to the ADIS [ASDD]), as well as parent reports of potentially overlapping symptoms that complicate the ASD anxiety phenotype. Additionally fMRI will be used to investigate neural predictors of treatment efficacy, markers of treatment induced change, and signatures of anxiety sub-types.","Inclusion Criteria:||Outpatient boys and girls with ASD between ages 8-14 years at consent.|Meets criteria for a diagnosis of ASD.|Meets criteria for clinically significant anxiety symptoms as defined by a minimum score of 8 on the PARS Severity Scale.|Meets criteria for clinically significant anxiety symptoms as defined by qualifying for diagnosis on 1 or more non-phobia items on the ADIS.|The child has a Verbal Comprehension IQ greater than 50 as assessed on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence or other standardized cognitive measure.|Anxiety symptoms are considered the primary mental health problem (i.e., most impairing/distressing)|Stable medication regimen for 8 weeks prior to screening visit, including alternative medication, nutritionals, or therapeutic diets.||Stable non-psychotherapy regimen for 4 weeks prior to screening visits.

Social anxiety is a condition characterized by fear of scrutiny and avoidance of social interactions. Social anxiety frequently compounds the considerable social challenges experienced by autistic adults. There are currently no FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments for autistic adults, although off-label prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are on the rise in this population.||Based on the known effects of MDMA, as well as individual reports from autistic adults, this exploratory study focused on enhancing functional skills in this underserved population, who tend to experience greater anxiety, depression and victimization than typically developing adults. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled exploratory pilot study assessed the safety and feasibility of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for social anxiety in MDMA-naïve adults on the autism spectrum.||The main objective of this study was to collect safety data to examine whether MDMA-assisted therapy was tolerated and to estimate symptom reduction in social anxiety and other psychiatric symptoms that are common in the adult autistic population as evaluated by standard clinical measures.

Before experimental sessions, participants underwent three separate hour-long preparatory sessions to learn what to expect and complete pre-treatment assignments. After each experimental session, participants underwent three separate hour-long integrative sessions to help integrate their experiences and insights from the experimental sessions.||This study was designed as a dose escalation study to assist with the exploration of safety and finding the most effective dose in this population. Upon enrollment, the first six subjects (Group 1) was randomized to receive one dose of either placebo (N=2) or 75 mg of MDMA (N=4). In the second experimental session one month later, Group 1 subjects randomized to MDMA escalated to 100 mg of MDMA, unless contraindicated. The second six subjects enrolled (Group 2) were randomized to receive one dose of either placebo (N=2) or 100 mg of MDMA (N=4). In the second experimental session one month later, Group 2 subjects randomized to MDMA escalated to 125 mg of MDMA, unless contraindicated.||The blind was maintained through the six-month follow-up. In Stage 2 after the blind was broken, subjects who received placebo in Stage 1 were offered an open-label extension with two experimental sessions of MDMA scheduled one month apart.
