In the third domain repetitive and stereotyped behavior as hand- and finger mannerisms, unusual sensory interest or activities are investigated by four subscales. Most items are scored from zero to three, relying on the interviewer to make judgements on child's behaviour based on the recall of information from parents/carers. .

The examiner selects the module that is most appropriate for a particular child, adolescent on the basis of his/her expressive language level and chronological age. Selected algorithm items relating to social interaction and communication are then entered into an algorithm.

The Centers for Disease Control estimates that ASD affects as many as 17 per 1000 children (1 in 59) in the United States suggesting that the prevalence is higher than previous estimates.Despite the dramatic rise in the detected prevalence of ASD over the past two decades, there is no effective medical treatment for core ASD symptoms (social communication and repetitive behavior), the closely associated problem of language impairment, or the underlying pathophysiology of ASD. Currently, the only accepted treatment for core ASD symptoms is behavior therapy, which may entail intensive one-on-one treatment over several years.||The primary aims of this study are to evaluate the effect of a wide-spectrum nutritional supplement on mitochondrial function in individuals with ASD. Participants entered into the trial will have abnormalities in mitochondrial function that are known to be associated with ASD (approximately 50+% of children with ASD) but are not diagnostic of mitochondrial disease. The investigators hypothesize that nutritional supplements designed for children with ASD have a physiological action of normalizing mitochondrial function and cellular physiology throughout the body.||To test whether the targeted nutritional supplement is superior to placebo, the investigators will study 50 children, between the ages of 4 years to 14 years, with confirmed ASD and known abnormal variations in mitochondrial at baseline. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive active treatment or placebo for 12-weeks under double-blind conditions and at the end of the 12 weeks switch to the opposite condition after a 2-week wash out period. Mitochondrial function will be measured at baseline and after each treatment arm in order to determine if the supplement positively influences cellular biochemistry. The investigator will also evaluate the effectiveness of the supplement on core and associated ASD symptoms using several behaviors assessments.","Inclusion Criteria:||Weight ≥ 15 kg and ≤ 100kg;|DSM-5 diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder as established by formal clinical assessment which includes a gold-standard tool such as the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule.|Current Clinical Global Impression Severity score ≥ 4|Stable educational and therapy plan (one month) with no planned changes in the intensity of treatment for 12 weeks.|English is spoken in the home and at least one parent is able to read, write and speak English.|Stable medication (no changes in past 6 weeks and no planned changes for the study duration.|Electron Transport Chain Complex (I, II, III, IV) or Citrate Synthase Activity which is >= 2.0 Standard Deviation Above or Below Average (outside the normal range)||Exclusion Criteria:||Presence of serious behavioral problems (tantrums, aggression, self-injury) for which another treatment is warranted.|Current Clinical Global Impression Severity score < 7 (Extremely Ill)|Significant medical condition by history or by physical examination or lab tests that would be incompatible with the treatment.|Children taking anticonvulsant medication for seizures or active epilepsy.|Diagnosis of Mitochondrial Disease",50.0,Anticipated,All,No,No,Wide-spectrum nutritional supplement|Placebo control,Comprehensive powder with 33 dietary supplements and 1 dietary supplement via gel capsule.|Inactive placebo comparator,Wide-spectrum nutritional supplement|Placebo,Drug|Other,2022-04-12,Actual,"April 11, 2022",OTHER,Phoenix Children's Hospital,Phoenix,United States,Phoenix Children's Hospital,368,Arizona,17 Years,2 Years,Effect of a Wide Spectrum Nutritional Supplement on Mitochondrial Function in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD),Phoenix Children's Hospital,Phoenix Children's Hospital,Recruiting,No,Phase 2,December 2022,Anticipated,"Mitochondrial activity and redox metabolism at baseline and after the placebo and supplement arms of the study, as determined through laboratory assessment.",Change in mitochondrial activity in study patients,"Baseline, Week 12, Week 24","Delhey LM, Nur Kilinc E, Yin L, Slattery JC, Tippett ML, Rose S, Bennuri SC, Kahler SG, Damle S, Legido A, Goldenthal MJ, Frye RE.

Each item is scored on a 4 point scale of severity from 1 (None/Minimal) to 4 (Severe). The measure is the total score of the 15 items in which a score of 15-27.5 reflects minimal to no severity of symptoms, 28-33.5 reflects mild to moderate severity of symptoms, and a score of 34 or higher reflects severe symptoms.|The Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S) is a clinician rated 7-point measure of overall symptomatic severity of psychopathology. Scores range from 1 (Normal, not at all ill) through 4 (Moderately ill) to 7 (Among the most extremely ill patients). The Clinical Global Impression - Improvement scale (CGI-I) is the companion measure that evaluates the change in the patient's symptoms relative to baseline. Scores range from 1 (Very much improved) through 4 (No Change) to 7 (Very much worse). Ratings are reflected in a single total score, in which a score of 2 (Much Improved) or 1 (Very Much Improved) on the CGI-I will be used as a secondary measure to define positive response.|The Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Autism Spectrum Disorder is a 5-item clinician-rated measure to evaluate severity of repetitive behavior in children with ASD. Each item is scored on a 5 point scale from 0 (None) to 4 (Extreme) for the severity of: Time Spent, Interference in everyday life, Distress, Resistance, and Degree of Control over the behavior. A decrease in the total score of the 5 items, ranging from 0 to 20, will be used as a secondary measure to define positive response.|The Aberrant Behavior Checklist is a 58-item caregiver questionnaire consisting of five subscales: hyperactivity, irritability, social withdrawal, stereotypic behavior and inappropriate speech in children with developmental disabilities. A higher score indicates more frequent aberrant behaviors. Our secondary measures are the subscale scores for Irritability (15 item), Social Withdrawal (16 item) and Hyperactivity (16 item). Each item rates behavior severity on a 4 point scale from 0 (Not at all a problem) to 3 (The problem is severe in degree). A decrease in the subscale scores, ranging from 0 to 45 (Irritability), 48 (Social Withdrawal) and 48 (Hyperactivity), will be used as secondary measures to define positive response.|The Parent-rated Anxiety Scale for Autism Spectrum Disorder is a 25-item scale that measures anxiety in youth with ASD.

Cannabidiol (CBD), a compound originally derived from the cannabis plant but without the psychoactive effects found in cannabis, has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of children with severe epilepsy. Two non-controlled studies using CBD from local sources have demonstrated improvements in behavior in children with autism. Parents of autistic children have been using CBD products in an unregulated fashion with unknown dosing with anecdotal reports of improved behavior. This study will use EPIDIOLEX (EPX), a purified CBD oral solution that was FDA approved in June 2018 to treat severe forms of pediatric epilepsy. Study subjects will be 30 boys between 7 and 14 years of age with autism who have severe behavior problems. Every child will undergo baseline clinical evaluation, neuropsychological, behavioral, cognitive, and language testing, will have a test of brain wave activity (EEG) and a brain MRI scan. parents will complete questionnaires on various aspects of their child's behavior. Fifteen children will receive CBD for 8 weeks and 15 will receive a placebo that looks and tastes similar to the CBD (Period 1). All of the baseline tests and questionnaires will then be repeated. After a 4 week washout period, behavioral and cognitive tests and questionnaires will be repeated and then the treatments will be reversed (Period 2). At the end of 8 weeks, all of the baseline tests and questionnaires will be repeated. Study personnel and parents will be blinded to the treatment status of each child.

Types and severities of adverse events will be tracked to provide information about the safety and tolerability of CBD in this population.

Effective early treatments that account for ADHD symptoms have not been developed for young children with ASD+ADHD. The overarching goals of this randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2, pilot study are to (1) evaluate a novel early intervention that pharmacologically addresses ADHD symptoms while providing an ASD-targeted behavioral intervention, and (2) identify changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie improved outcomes in children with comorbid ASD and ADHD ages 3-10 years. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether a stimulant treatment augments efficacy of an ASD specific form of parent child therapy based on the Early Start Denver Model called ESDM influenced Parent Coaching. Secondary aims are to determine the efficacy of combined intervention in improving ADHD symptoms and the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Adzenys-XR-ODT in young children with ASD+ADHD. The study will also examine correlations between behavioral changes and state-of-the-art eye-gaze tracking (EGT) and electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers to elucidate key ways in which ADHD impacts attentional and neural functioning in ASD+ADHD, and to potentially identify new targets for intervention in children with ASD+ADHD. The study is about 8 months long and will involve screening, baseline assessment followed by 10- 11 weeks of study drug treatment (active or placebo) and 8 sessions of ESDM informed parent coaching beginning after 2 weeks of study drug treatment, primary endpoint assessments at ~11 weeks, AE follow-up by phone at ~week 13 and remote FU 24 weeks after baseline. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to the active medication or placebo, Between weeks 11 to 24, it is expected that the parent will use the behavioral strategies they were coached in even though they will not receive parent coaching.
