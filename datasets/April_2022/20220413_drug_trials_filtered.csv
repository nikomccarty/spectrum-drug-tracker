However, basic research suggests that some forms of ASD may be alleviated, even in the adult stage. The genes involved in ASDs particularly impact synaptic homeostasis. Specific clinical trials in patients with synaptic mutations need to be carried out. In this spirit, patients with deleterious mutations in SHANK3 represent a paradigm. The induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSc) carrying SHANK3 mutations and derived in neurons, can be used for high-throughput screening of pharmacological substances and allow the identification of compounds that can restore the expression level of SHANK3. The objective of this proposed project is to test one of the compounds identified by research on these iPSc as a novel treatment for social communication deficit in patients with deleterious mutations in SHANK3.

Children with ASD often have difficulty communicating symptoms or tolerating Polysomnography (Sleep Study). This makes establishing a diagnosis of RLS or PLMS very difficult in children with ASD. Because polysomnography is not well tolerated in children with ASD and cannot measure sleep over time in a natural environment, improvements in sleep with treatment with iron will be measured by standard actigraphy (a watch that measures movements during sleep) and sleep diaries. The investigators also propose to evaluate periodic limb movement index (PLMI) as a predictor of response to iron treatment for insomnia in children with ASD, as measured by the PAM-RL, an actigraph designed to measure PLMS. The investigators will collect secondary data regarding attention and behavior over the course of the study to monitor improvement in daytime functioning in both groups. Many clinicians will empirically treat children with ASD, insomnia and low ferritin levels (< 50ng/ml) with iron. This is based on data from a previous open label trial demonstrating subjective improvement in restless sleep in children with ASD with low/low normal ferritin levels who were treated with iron. In order to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment, The investigators propose a randomized placebo-controlled trial of oral elemental iron for treatment of insomnia in children with ASD and ferritin levels that are low but above the laboratory cut off for deficiency. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of treatment of insomnia with oral ferrous sulfate (iron) at a dose of 3mg/kg divided twice per day for 3 months compared to placebo.","Inclusion Criteria:||Child has a clinical diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) criteria, confirmed by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule.|Age 2 years to 10 years 11 months.|Child has sleep onset latency of greater than 40 minutes on 3 or more nights per week, an average greater than 30 minutes per night, or night waking at least 3 times per week requiring parental intervention or lasting >20 minutes per night.|A mean sleep latency of 30 minutes or more, or night waking will be need to be confirmed by 7 days of scorable actigraphy data prior to randomization.|Ferritin between 17ng/ml and 49 ng/ml, confirmed at a central lab.|The child has been screened for medical conditions that affect sleep by their clinician and referred for subspecialty evaluation, as needed, for coexisting disorders (e.g., Gastrointestinal reflux disease, epilepsy).|We will include children with coexisting medical, psychiatric, and neurological disorders as long as they have been evaluated by a physician and a treatment plan has been implemented, with the child on a stable dose of medication for one month|Parents and their child are willing and able to provide informed consent (and assent, depending on child's age and cognitive function) and to cooperate with study procedures.

This will help us determine if pre-treatment with vancomycin is needed or not.||Part 3: Follow-up There will be follow-up evaluations at 6, 12, and 18 months after treatment is stopped, to assess long-term efficacy and possible adverse effects.","Inclusion Criteria:||Adult aged 18-60 years|Diagnosis of autism per both the Autism Diagnostic Interview - Revised (ADI-R) and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale 2 (CARS-2).|GI disorder as defined below that has lasted for at least 3 years.|No changes in medications, supplements, diet, therapies, or education in last 3 months, and no intention to change them during the clinical trial.|General good physical health aside from gastrointestinal problems|Neurotypical adult observer (such as parent, guardian, or sibling) who observes adult for at least 4 hours/week who can serve as an Evaluator to complete questionnaires on their symptoms with the assistance of the Participant as much as they are able.|Ability to swallow pills (without chewing)||Exclusion Criteria:||Antibiotics in last 3 months|Probiotics in last 2 months, or fecal transplant in last 12 months|Single-gene disorder (Fragile X, etc.)|Major brain malformation|Tube feeding|Severe gastrointestinal problems that require immediate treatment (life-threatening)|Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn's Disease, diagnosed Celiac Disease, Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis, or similar conditions|Severely underweight/malnourished|Recent or scheduled surgeries|Current participation in other clinical trials|Females who are pregnant or who are sexually active without effective birth control.

The Centers for Disease Control estimates that ASD affects as many as 14.7 per 1000 children (1 in 68). Despite the dramatic rise in the detected prevalence of ASD over the past two decades, no effective medical treatment has been developed to address core ASD symptoms (social communication and repetitive behavior), the closely associated problem of language impairment, or the underlying pathophysiology of ASD. Currently, the only accepted treatment for core ASD symptoms is behavior therapy, which may entail intensive one-on-one treatment over several years.||The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of folinic acid in the treatment of language problems in children with autism spectrum disorder. Folinic acid, also known as leucovorin, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to decrease side effects during cancer chemotherapy. Folinic acid may be helpful in treating language problems in children with autism spectrum disorder, but this is not known. Therefore, folinic acid is an investigational new drug for this study.||The primary aims of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of high-dose folinic acid for improving the closely associated symptoms of language impairment in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Improvement in delayed language may also benefit the core ASD problem of social communication. The study will also focus on identification of biomarkers in pre-specified subgroups of children with ASD that may moderate positive response to folinic acid. The study model is that high-dose folinic acid will improve language and set the stage for improved social communication in children with ASD and moderate language impairment. To test whether folinic acid is superior to placebo, 134 children (age 5 to 12 yrs 6 months, inclusive) with ASD and moderate language will be randomly assigned to folinic acid or placebo for 12 weeks under double-blind conditions. The study team will also test whether abnormalities in folate-dependent pathways, such as dysfunctional transport of folate across the blood-brain barrier, will moderate positive response to folinic acid treatment.","Inclusion Criteria:||Boys and girls ≥ 5 years and < 12 years 5 months of age;|Weight ≥ 15 kg;|DSM-5 diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder as established by clinical assessment, corroborated by the Social Communication Questionnaire and the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule.|A score < 80 on the Core Language score of the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals -4 (CELF)- 4 or the Second Edition of the CELF-Preschool test (CELF-P).|Current Clinical Global Impression Severity score ≥ 4 on ASD + communication delay.|IQ at least 40 as measured by the Leiter-3 or mental age at least 18 months as measured on the Receptive Language Scale of the Mullen.|Stable educational plan (one month) with no planned changes in the intensity of treatment for 12 weeks.

The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of an investigational drug, AZD7325, as a potential treatment for high-functioning adults 18 -35 years old with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The primary study measures are effects on brain waves as measured by non-invasive brain wave recordings (electroencephalograms or EEGs), assessments of side effects, and measures of attention and learning.||The study drug, AZD7325, is manufactured by Astra Zeneca, and was initially tested as a medication for anxiety disorders in over 488 subjects, but was not pursued for marketing due to too few benefits for anxiety. AZD7325 was found to have a very good safety profile and was tolerated by the majority of subjects. AZD7325 has some similar actions to currently marketed anxiety drugs in the benzodiazepine class, but lacks the sedative and negative effects on attention of the benzodiazepines. The study drug is designed to target the GABA neurotransmitter system which is believed to be abnormal in this population.||There are 2 study phases. Phase 1 includes the recruitment of 24 healthy volunteers without mental disorder (6 per site) in order to establish normal EEG reference ranges. Controls will only be seen for one study visit which includes a clinical evaluation, physical exam, routine blood tests, and an EEG. Once control recruitment is complete, Phase 2 will begin.||Phase 2 involves the recruitment of 40 adults (10 per site) 18 - 35 years old with a diagnosis of ASD, normal intelligence, and specific EEG patterns compared to control values. Screening for eligibility will be performed in one visit, which includes a clinical evaluation, tests of learning and intelligence, blood and urine tests, and an EEG. Those subjects who are found to be eligible will be enrolled in a 6-week medication study. Subjects with ASD who are enrolled will be randomly assigned to receive the study drug AZD7325 or placebo in matching capsules. Subjects will be seen weekly by study physicians and clincians for the 7 study visits, including 3 additional EEG recordings, and then for a final follow-up visit (9 total visits including screening lasting up to 11 weeks to complete).

Individuals with ASD often have behavioral issues and psychiatric comorbidities which can be very hard to manage. Currently, there are only two FDA approved medications (aripiprazole and risperidone) for the treatment of irritability in ASD. Both medications have the potential for side effects and are not tolerated in all children with ASD. Anecdotal and some preliminary studies suggest that cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid in the marijuana plant, may lead to improvements in symptoms of ASD including irritability, aggressive behaviors, and anxiety.||In this study the investigators will test whether CBD leads to differences in behaviors commonly associated with ASD. The main behavioral problems investigators will study are irritability and aggressive behavior. This study will also measure changes in other behaviors seen in ASD such as anxiety, social interaction difficulties, repetitive behaviors, attentional problems, hyperactivity, repetitive behaviors, and quality of life. Study investigators will also test whether there are any important side effects of CBD in children and adolescents with ASD.","Inclusion Criteria:||Male or female children and adolescents aged 5-17 years, inclusive, at the time of screening.|Judged by the investigator to be in good health at screening based upon the results of a medical history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory test results.|Patients must have a previous documented diagnosis of ASD by a medical or psychological professional.|Patients must be assessed by the Investigator as being moderately to severely impacted due to ASD|Patients who are taking psychotropic medication(s) should be on a stable regimen of no more than 2 medications for at least 4 weeks preceding study Screening and must maintain that regimen throughout the study.

Currently the only well-accepted treatment for core ASD symptoms is behavior therapy such as Applied Behavioral Analysis and Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention. There is no US Food and Drug Administration approved medical therapy that addresses core ASD symptoms or the pathophysiological processes that underlie ASD.||The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a liquid form of leucovorin calcium on language impairments in very young children with ASD. Participants entered into the trial will have delayed social and communication abilities known to be associated with ASD. The investigators hypothesize that leucovorin calcium will significantly improve language as well as core and associated behavioral symptoms of ASD, and be well-tolerated with no significant adverse effects, in young children with ASD. The investigators further hypothesize that a combination of baseline cellular and genetic biomarkers will predict cognitive and behavioral response to the intervention.||To assess whether the liquid form of leucovorin calcium is superior to placebo, the investigators will study 80 children across two sites, between the ages of 2.5 and 5 years, with confirmed ASD and known language delays at baseline. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive active treatment or placebo for 12 weeks under double-blind conditions. At the end of 12 weeks, all participants will receive active treatment for 12 weeks. Language skills, as well as specimen biomarkers, will be measured at screening and after each treatment arm in order to determine if the supplement positively influences language ability.","Inclusion Criteria:||Autism Spectrum Disorder (as defined below).|Between 2 years 6 months and 5 years 2 months of age at baseline|Language impairment (Ages and Stage Questionnaire between -1 and -3 SD for Language and MSEL Expressive Language <=40)|English included in the languages in which the child is being raised|Autism severity of moderate or higher (≥4) under the 7-item clinical global impression-severity scale.

Cannabidivarin (CBDV) is a nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid and a safe variant of Cannabidiol (CBD). It has no appreciable tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) [less than 0.01%], has been shown to have no impact on weight or metabolism, and improves both social and cognitive functioning in animal models of idiopathic and syndromal autism (Fragile X, Rett Syndrome, Angelman Syndrome). The CDC currently estimates 1 in 59 children have ASD. ASD is characterized by deficits in social communication, irritability, repetitive behaviors, impulsivity, temper tantrums, and high caregiver burden. Currently, the only FDA-approved medications for symptoms of ASD are aripiprazole and risperidone, both of which are indicated for irritability in pediatric ASD. These medications are effective but are associated with considerable side effects with long term treatment in this chronic developmental disorder, including weight gain, metabolic syndrome and the risk of type 2 diabetes, prolactin elevation and growth of breast tissue, extrapyramidal symptoms and the risk of tardive dyskinesia. The anticonvulsant divalproex sodium (valproate/VPA) also significantly reduces irritability and repetitive behaviors in individuals with ASD. Although VPA is efficacious for pediatric epilepsy and some symptoms of ASD, it also has significant side effects, including weight gain, sedation and nausea. CBDV, like VPA, is effective in the treatment of pediatric epilepsy, and ASD mouse models demonstrate potential mechanisms for treatment with CBDV, including potential therapeutic effects on repetitive behaviors, irritability, sociability, and quality of life, and the capacity to reduce inflammation. This study aims to examine the efficacy and safety of cannabidivarin (CBDV) with a primary aim of studying its effect on irritability in children with ASD.||STUDY DESIGN: This is a 12-week randomized, double-blind study of CBDV vs. placebo in 100 child and adolescent subjects aged 5 to 18 years with a diagnosis of ASD.","Inclusion Criteria||Male or Female pediatric outpatients aged between and including ages 5 to 18.

The Centers for Disease Control estimates that ASD affects as many as 17 per 1000 children (1 in 59) in the United States suggesting that the prevalence is higher than previous estimates.Despite the dramatic rise in the detected prevalence of ASD over the past two decades, there is no effective medical treatment for core ASD symptoms (social communication and repetitive behavior), the closely associated problem of language impairment, or the underlying pathophysiology of ASD. Currently, the only accepted treatment for core ASD symptoms is behavior therapy, which may entail intensive one-on-one treatment over several years.||The primary aims of this study are to evaluate the effect of a wide-spectrum nutritional supplement on mitochondrial function in individuals with ASD. Participants entered into the trial will have abnormalities in mitochondrial function that are known to be associated with ASD (approximately 50+% of children with ASD) but are not diagnostic of mitochondrial disease. The investigators hypothesize that nutritional supplements designed for children with ASD have a physiological action of normalizing mitochondrial function and cellular physiology throughout the body.||To test whether the targeted nutritional supplement is superior to placebo, the investigators will study 50 children, between the ages of 4 years to 14 years, with confirmed ASD and known abnormal variations in mitochondrial at baseline. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive active treatment or placebo for 12-weeks under double-blind conditions and at the end of the 12 weeks switch to the opposite condition after a 2-week wash out period. Mitochondrial function will be measured at baseline and after each treatment arm in order to determine if the supplement positively influences cellular biochemistry.

Individuals with a disorder in the autism spectrum are a heterogeneous group of patients with early childhood onset of deficits in social interaction, communication and language, and repetitive and stereotypic behaviors. ASD has become increasingly prevalent during the last few decades (Wiznitzer, 2005).||The neuro-anatomical substrate of ASD has been the subject of intense investigation, but current findings are inconclusive, limited and sometimes even contradictory.||Medical treatment of autism is still a matter of dispute. Medications used are mainly aimed to treat the comorbid symptoms, such as epilepsy, tics, obsessive-compulsive or hyperactive behaviors (Wiznitzer, 2005). Although many efforts were invested in establishing a model of autistic pathophysiology, no such model is currently accepted, and there is no evidence for an efficient treatment of the core autistic symptoms (Wiznitzer, 2005).||Previous studies indicate that many brain systems are involved in the expression of autism. Specifically, it has been suggested that autism involves neurotransmitter dysregulations (Lam et al, 2006).

These symptoms are associated with increased social deficits, depression, irritability, and stereotyped and self-injurious behaviors. Children and adolescents with anxiety also frequently avoid potentially stressful situations, thereby missing opportunities to learn important new skills. Despite the significant consequences of anxiety symptoms, several critical treatment-relevant issues remain unresolved. First, there is a lack of clarity about how to differentiate ASD and anxiety symptoms. Second, little is known about how anxiety manifests in those with ASD and intellectual disability (ID). Third, the neural substrates of anxiety in ASD are poorly understood. The overarching goal of this project is to investigate these open issues in order to make interventions more precise, more personalized, and more likely to promote positive outcomes -- an objective consistent with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Roadmap, Precision Medicine, and Research Domain Criteria Project (RDoC) Initiatives and the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) Strategic Plan, Chapter 4.||While there is no doubt that anxiety is a very serious issue for those with ASD, what to do about this problem is less clear. The search for empirically-validated treatments has begun with multiple small trials providing promising evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) might reduce anxiety in those with ASD. However, this work is in its early stages. There is a great need for large, rigorously designed trials that validate the effectiveness of both medication and CBT, as well as functional neuroimaging studies that identify neural predictors of treatment efficacy and markers of therapy-induced change. Such work holds the potential to help answer the questions posed above and to assist the field in developing more personalized treatments. In Project 1 of the Center for the Development of Phenotype-Based Treatments of Autism Spectrum Disorder, we will conduct a study in children with ASD and clinically significant anxiety ages 8-14 to compare efficacy of these different treatment types.||The overall aims of the study are to better characterize the sub-group of children and preadolescents with ASD that exhibit clinically significant anxiety and fears through a 16-week randomized comparative treatment trial of Behavioral Intervention for Anxiety in Children with Autism (BIACA), sertraline, and placebo in youth with ASD, IQ>50, and clinically significant anxiety as assessed by a PARS score that is greater than or equal to 8. Clinician-administered gold standard assays will be used of traditional DSM (Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale [PARS] and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-IV [ADIS-IV]), and nontraditional ASD related anxiety symptoms (Autism Spectrum Addendum to the ADIS [ASDD]), as well as parent reports of potentially overlapping symptoms that complicate the ASD anxiety phenotype. Additionally fMRI will be used to investigate neural predictors of treatment efficacy, markers of treatment induced change, and signatures of anxiety sub-types.","Inclusion Criteria:||Outpatient boys and girls with ASD between ages 8-14 years at consent.|Meets criteria for a diagnosis of ASD.|Meets criteria for clinically significant anxiety symptoms as defined by a minimum score of 8 on the PARS Severity Scale.|Meets criteria for clinically significant anxiety symptoms as defined by qualifying for diagnosis on 1 or more non-phobia items on the ADIS.|The child has a Verbal Comprehension IQ greater than 50 as assessed on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence or other standardized cognitive measure.|Anxiety symptoms are considered the primary mental health problem (i.e., most impairing/distressing)|Stable medication regimen for 8 weeks prior to screening visit, including alternative medication, nutritionals, or therapeutic diets.||Stable non-psychotherapy regimen for 4 weeks prior to screening visits.

Cannabidiol (CBD), a compound originally derived from the cannabis plant but without the psychoactive effects found in cannabis, has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of children with severe epilepsy. Two non-controlled studies using CBD from local sources have demonstrated improvements in behavior in children with autism. Parents of autistic children have been using CBD products in an unregulated fashion with unknown dosing with anecdotal reports of improved behavior. This study will use EPIDIOLEX (EPX), a purified CBD oral solution that was FDA approved in June 2018 to treat severe forms of pediatric epilepsy. Study subjects will be 30 boys between 7 and 14 years of age with autism who have severe behavior problems. Every child will undergo baseline clinical evaluation, neuropsychological, behavioral, cognitive, and language testing, will have a test of brain wave activity (EEG) and a brain MRI scan. parents will complete questionnaires on various aspects of their child's behavior. Fifteen children will receive CBD for 8 weeks and 15 will receive a placebo that looks and tastes similar to the CBD (Period 1). All of the baseline tests and questionnaires will then be repeated. After a 4 week washout period, behavioral and cognitive tests and questionnaires will be repeated and then the treatments will be reversed (Period 2). At the end of 8 weeks, all of the baseline tests and questionnaires will be repeated. Study personnel and parents will be blinded to the treatment status of each child. Statistical analyses will be used to determine whether there are significant differences between baseline testing and results after placebo or CBD treatment. Types and severities of adverse events will be tracked to provide information about the safety and tolerability of CBD in this population. If CBD is found to be safe and effective in treating the behavioral problems associated with autism, this would be a major new tool in the treatment of those children that could lead to improved functioning and quality of life for the affected individuals and their families.","Inclusion Criteria:||Boys ages 7-14 years|Confirmed diagnosis of autism based on ADOS testing|Autism severity assessed as severe with substantial behavioral problems||Severity of symptoms will be based on a number of criteria:||Aggressive and/or self-injurious (SIBs) behaviors occur almost daily (more than 6 times per week) in any situation (home, school, clinic, etc.).|Frequent (daily), persistent (lasting at least 5-10 minutes and repeated through the day) stereotypies (repetitive behaviors such as hand flapping, running in circles, jumping repeatedly, waving fingers in front of eyes)|Pervasive hyperactivity (child is so physically active that he cannot sit for meals or school work, is moving all the time, jumping off furniture, climbing onto furniture, etc.)|One of more of the above activities is deemed to contribute significantly to child's inability to function by parental report and with clinician agreement based on history and/or direct observation||Exclusion Criteria:||the presence of epilepsy|a known genetic condition such as tuberous sclerosis|other significant health issues such as cardiac disease, presence of known congenital brain malformation, or a history of central nervous system infection.|children who are on anticonvulsant medications such as clobazam or valproic acid will also be excluded because of potential drug-drug interactions.

It is usually first diagnosed in early childhood. Children with autism demonstrate repetitive behaviors or interests and deficits in social interaction, verbal communication, and nonverbal communication. In addition, they often have unusual responses to sensory experiences, such as certain sounds or the way objects look. Some symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, are also associated with autism. Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is used to treat ADHD. It works differently, however, than stimulant drugs and may help to reduce ADHD symptoms in children with autism. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of atomoxetine in treating children with ADHD symptoms associated with autism.||Potential participants will first attend a screening visit, which will include a psychiatric diagnostic interview, a practice session for swallowing pill capsules, a physical exam, an electrocardiogram (ECG), a blood test, and an assessment of pubertal stage. Females of childbearing age will also undergo a urine pregnancy test. In an initial double-blind study phase, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive either atomoxetine or placebo for 8 weeks. A baseline visit will include several rating scales, observations, and an interview to assess adaptive functioning. These measures and procedures will be used to keep track of symptoms, side effects, and behavior that could change during the study. Children who are assigned to placebo and do not notice an improvement in their ADHD symptoms will be given the opportunity to receive atomoxetine at the end of 8 weeks. Study visits will occur once a week for 4 weeks, and then every other week for the remainder of the 8 weeks. During these visits, many of the baseline questionnaires and interviews will be repeated. At the Week 8 visit, the physical exam, ECG, blood tests, and some baseline questionnaires will also be repeated. All children who respond well to atomoxetine may continue taking the drug for an additional 10 months. During this time, participants will report to the clinic once a month for the first 4 months, then once at the end of 7 months, and finally once at the end of 10 months. The same measures and procedures that were done during the 8-week phase will be done during the 10-month phase of this study.","Inclusion Criteria:||Diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder (autistic disorder, Asperger's syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified).|Significant hyperactivity, inattention, or impulsivity as determined by a score on an investigator-administered ADHD Rating Scale (ADHDRS)-Home Version that is at least 1.5 standard deviations above the mean for age and sex|Parent/caregiver's primary complaint about the child is inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity (""ADHD"" symptoms)|Symptoms present for 6 months prior to study entry|Psychotropic drug-free for at least 2 weeks prior to starting study medication.

This study will attempt to study the effect of an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) inhibitor, memantine, on memory, and motor praxis/expressive language skills in children with autism.||Methods: Children ages 6-12 years who are verbal and meet criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder will be recruited across 2 sites. After consent, the children will be assessed for memory function, expressive language output and motor skills/praxis. They will then be randomized 1:1 to memantine versus placebo for 6 months. The effects of this medication on the above mentioned symptoms domains as well as its safety in this population will be studied over the 6 month period.","Inclusion Criteria||Male or female outpatients 6 to 12 years of age|Verbal; Module 2 or 3 on Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)|Meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) for Autism Spectrum Disorder.

Some of these children spend very little time in the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep. Some studies suggest that less time in REM sleep can be associated with learning and behavior problems. Donepezil is a medication used to treat Alzheimer s disease. Donepezil can increase REM sleep in some adults with different disorders. A small study showed that Donepezil can also increase REM sleep in children with ASD. Researchers now want to see if Donepezil can improve communication skills and social interaction in children with ASD. They also want to see if any change in symptoms seems to come from changes in REM sleep.||Objectives:||- To see if a medication, Donepezil, can improve the way communication skills and social interaction develop in young children with autism spectrum disorders.||Eligibility:||- Children 22 to 44 months of age with ASD.||Design:||Participants will be screened with a blood test, heart tests, and a sleep study.

Study population||90 children with an autism spectrum disorder between the ages of 24 to 50 months will be screened via polysomnogram to find 45 with a relative REM deficiency. This group will then be divided into two arms of drug versus placebo. Allowing for a 22 % drop out rate we expect 17 in each group to complete the study. Additionally, we will enroll 16 children with an ASD who do not meet criteria for relative REM deficiency in an open label arm to ascertain whether or not donepezil is beneficial to behavior in this group.||iii.

These visits cannot be completed at any other hospital. Parents will fill out questionnaires and undergo a structured interview reporting on their child's health, behavior, and mood. Subjects will undergo clinical and physical examinations by a study doctor. Non-invasive devices and cameras will also be used to monitor things like breathing, hand movements, heart rate, and body temperature. Blood and urine will be collected for routine laboratory tests to monitor for safety. Investigators will also monitor safety by asking parents to complete a medication diary and side effect reporting form on a regular basis. Between trips to Boston Children's Hospital, parents will complete a set of online questionnaires and undergo a structured interview over the phone.||The cost of travel and lodging during research-related visits to and from the hospital will not be covered by the study. If a condition or illness is identified during the trial (and is determined to be unrelated to study treatments), referrals to outside medical care will be made. Study medications and all research-related materials and services will be provided at no cost to participants. Parking vouchers will be provided for all study-related hospital visits.||The study is investigating 5 potential effects:||IGF-1 may improve subjects' behavior, communication and/or mood. In order to measure this, investigators will evaluate subjects every 5 weeks throughout each treatment period with behavioral and psychological assessments. All of the tests used during these evaluations are non-invasive. Investigators will ask parents what their impressions are about their child's behavior and day-to-day activities through a structured parental interview and various questionnaires.|Investigators will examine subjects' brain function through use of a brain- monitoring device known as electroencephalography (EEG). The EEG measurements will be taken while investigators present subjects with exercises to stimulate their vision and hearing. EEG is a non-invasive way of recording the electrical activity of a subject's brain by applying a net of monitors (electrodes) to their scalp. Through this method investigators gain insight into how brain processes visual and auditory stimulus.|As one of the features of RTT is unstable vital signs, investigators are trying to determine if IGF-1 has any effect on normalizing subjects' heart rate and breathing patterns. To measure this, investigators will ask subjects to wear a non-invasive device that includes three electrocardiogram connectors and two stretchy bands that wrap around her chest and abdomen to measure heart rate and respiratory patterns.|The safety of IGF-1 in children with RTT is very important. Investigators will ask parents to complete a medication diary and side effect reporting form on a regular basis. In addition, laboratory tests will be performed every 10 weeks throughout each treatment period to evaluate the safety of IGF-1. These will be blood tests similar to those provided in typical clinical care. Subjects will undergo regular non-invasive comprehensive physical and neurological examinations, tonsil evaluation, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, scoliosis x-ray, bone age x-ray, ophthalmological exam, and measurements of height, weight and head circumference.|Children with RTT often experience unintended, stereotyped hand movements. The Qsensor® is a non-invasive device worn on a fabric bracelet that continually measures subjects' movement. Investigators will use the Qsensor® to determine whether or not IGF-1 affects the presentation of stereotyped hand movements. As such, investigators will ask subjects to wear the Qsensor® during study visits every 10 weeks throughout each treatment period and occasionally at home.","Inclusion Criteria:||Diagnosis of ""classic"" (or ""typical"") Rett Syndrome|Genetic documentation of MECP2 mutation|Subject must be post-regression (Hagberg Stage 2)|Subject and caregiver's primary language must be English|Subject must reside in North America (US and Canada)|Caregiver must have internet access and be able to complete questionnaires online and communicate via email|Subject is stable on current medications for at least 4 weeks|Subject's regimen of non-pharmacological interventions (physical therapy, speech therapy, etc.) is stable for at least 90 days||Exclusion Criteria:||Severe scoliosis (curvature >40 degrees)|Bone-age greater than 11 years|Cardiomegaly (enlarged heart)|Tanner stage 2 or higher breast development|Allergy to IGF-1|Prior use of IGF-1, growth hormone, or sex steroids",30.0,Actual,Female,No,,Treatment Period 1|Treatment Period 2|Treatment Period 1|Treatment Period 2,Subjects will receive twice daily subcutaneous injections of IGF-1.|Subjects will receive twice daily subcutaneous injections of a saline solution (placebo).,Recombinant Human Insulin Growth Factor 1 (rhIGF-1)|Placebo,Drug|Drug,"March 26, 2018",Actual,"March 23, 2018",OTHER,Boston Children's Hospital,Boston,United States,Boston Children's Hospital,572,Massachusetts,10 Years,2 Years,Pharmacological Treatment of Rett Syndrome by Stimulation of Synaptic Maturation With Recombinant Human IGF-1(Mecasermin [rDNA] Injection),Boston Children's Hospital,Boston Children's Hospital,Completed,Yes,Phase 2,July 2016,Actual,"The RSBQ is an informant/parent-completed measure of abnormal behaviors typically observed in individuals with RTT, which is completed by a parent/caregiver/LAR.

The Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator of this study have previously documented: 1) an association between ASD and a single nuclear polymorphism of the oxytocin receptor gene, 2) ability to measure oxytocin levels in the blood by enzyme immunoassay and 3) preliminary data to support safety and efficacy of intranasal oxytocin in the treatment of social deficits and repetitive behaviors in adults with autism. A medication treatment targeting the core deficits of ASD in childhood is highly valuable because it could influence the developmental trajectory and make further psychosocial interventions possible.

In EEG studies, electric patterns that resemble epileptic seizures are known as epileptiform pattern. These patterns are associated with an increased risk of seizures, even in people who have not been diagnosed with epilepsy. Epileptiform patterns also appear on the EEGs of some children who have autism spectrum disorders but do not have epilepsy. It is unclear if these discharges are related in any way to the symptoms of autism (behavior, language or intellectual abilities).|Divalproex sodium (Depakote) is a drug that has been used for many years to treat epilepsy and other brain disorders in children and adults. Researchers are interested determining whether treatment with divalproex sodium can reduce epileptiform patterns in children with autism spectrum disorders, and in doing so study whether this treatment can improve behavior, language or cognition in children with autism spectrum disorders.||Objectives:||- To study the effectiveness of using divalproex sodium to reduce epileptiform EEG discharges in children with autism spectrum disorders.||Eligibility:||- Children between 3 and 10 years of age who have an autism spectrum disorder and show frequent epileptiform discharges on an overnight EEG.||Design:||This study will last for a total of 9 months, with 6 months of treatment with either divalproex sodium or a placebo followed by 3 months of treatment with divalproex sodium only.|Potential participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, blood samples, and psychological tests, and will spend the night in the NIH Clinical Center to have an overnight EEG.

ASDs are neurodevelopmental disorders that result in abnormalities of social and language development and are associated with rigid and repetitive behaviors. ASD prevalence may be as common as 1 in 110 and as many as 1/3 of these individuals have seizures. Abnormal electroencephalograms (EEGs) (without seizure activity) are even more prevalent (Spence & Schneider, 2009). In an ongoing study at the NIMH, approximately 50% of children without epilepsy had epileptiform discharges present on overnight EEG. The relationship between this abnormal activity and autism symptoms has not yet been studied; however, data from other epilepsy syndromes suggest that these epileptiform discharges contribute to behavioral and cognitive deficits. It is also unknown whether or not reduction of the epileptiform discharges will result in improved behavior and more rapid intellectual and social development in children with ASD. This pilot study is designed to address that question.||Study Population||100 children with ASDs including Autistic Disorder, Asperger's or PDD-NOS ages 3-10 will be screened to find up to 40 children with frequent epileptiform discharges noted on overnight EEG. Allowing for up to 20% drop out, we expect at least 32 to complete the study.||Design||The proposed investigation is a 9 month long trial with a 6 month double-blind placebo controlled trial of divalproex sodium (Depakote) and a 3 month open label extension phase. Prior to study entry, potential subjects will be evaluated with the standard PDN diagnostic/behavioral assessment (06-M-0065). Children meeting eligibility criteria will undergo an overnight EEG and those with frequent epileptiform discharges will be randomly assigned to receive divalproex sodium or placebo. Study drugs will be administered in a blinded fashion for 24 weeks with overnight EEG at 12 and 24 weeks. Biweekly then monthly visits with laboratory studies will monitor for behavioral improvement and for potential adverse effects. A 3 month open label extension phase follows.||Outcome Measures||The primary outcome measure will be EEG changes; tolerability and changes in behavioral symptoms will be exploratory secondary outcome assessments. It is hypothesized that divalproex will be superior to placebo in reducing epileptiform discharges on the EEG. In addition, exploratory analyses will investigate whether children who demonstrate improvements and even normalization of the EEG pattern will have more associated behavioral improvements than those for whom the EEG does not improve.","INCLUSION CRITERIA:||Have a diagnosis of Autistic Disorder, Asperger's syndrome, or Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS).|Are aged 3 to 10 years.|Weigh at least 12.5 kg.|Only children with frequent epileptiform EEG activity on the overnight EEG at NIH will be randomized to start study drug.

All stimuli are presented on a Tobii T120 binocular eye tracker monitor. The system consists of a high-resolution camera embedded in a 17-inch TFT monitor. Stimuli consist of sixty colored photographs of adult human face (equal numbers of males and females, different races and ethnicities) from the NimStim Face Stimulus Set, each showing a calm, happy, or fearful expression, and sixty scrambled versions of the face images. Shown here are the averaged response times (in seconds) to the presented stimuli, at the 6-month follow-up visit.|The Preschool Language Scale-fifth edition (PLS-5) is designed to measure auditory comprehension (AC) and expressive communication (EC) for children birth to 7 years 11 months. The measure examines the child's attention, play, gestures, social communication, semantics, language structure, integrative language skills and emergent literacy skills. The PLS-5 has expanded coverage of early play behaviors, concepts, Theory of Mind, as well as emergent literacy skills. The PLS-5 yields norm-referenced scores including standard scores, percentile ranks and age equivalents for the AC and EC scales as well as for Total Language (TL). Raw score ranges are 0 to 65 in AC, 0 to 67 in EC, and therefore 0 to 132 in TL (calculated by summing AC+EC raw scores). The higher the scores, the greater the language ability. Shown here are the mean TL raw scores from the 6-month follow-up visit.|The Sensory Processing Measure - Preschool (SPM-P) is a questionnaire that was used to measure specific problems, including under- and over-responsiveness, sensory-seeking behavior, and perceptual problems in multiple environments (at home, at school, and in the community) for children aged 2 to 5 years old. The SPM-P provides norm-referenced standard scores for two higher level integrative functions (praxis and social participation) and five sensor sensory systems (visual, auditory, tactile, proprioceptive, and vestibular functioning). The SPM-P was administered to the caregiver at baseline and again at the 6-month follow-up visit. Reported here is the Social Participation subscale mean raw score from the 6-month visit, which ranges from 8 to 32. The lower the raw score, the more limited the child's level of social participation. The higher the score, the greater the child's level of social participation.|The Sensory Profile is designed to measure sensory-related difficulties. This measure will be administered to the primary caregiver of each subject to measure the caregiver's sensory ability and its impact on the subject. Of the four subscales scored in the Sensory Profile, the ""Sensation Seeking"" subscale mean raw scores for the placebo and treatment groups are reported here. This subscale has a raw scores range from 0 to 95, with scores 0-6 indicating that the child is sensation seeking much less than others, 7-19 less than others, 20-47 just like the majority of others, 48-60 more than others, and 61-95 much more than others.|The Vineland-II measures the personal and social skills of individuals from birth through adulthood. It was designed to assess handicapped and non-handicapped persons in their personal and social functioning and is appropriate for individuals of all ages. The Vineland-II is a survey that is administered to a parent or caregiver using a semi-structured interview format and is organized around four Behavior Domains: Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, and Motor Skills. Each subtest is scored with a standard score X=100 ± 15 and summed to calculate the Adaptive Behavior Composite (ABC) using age-adjusted scoring tables. Reported here are the ABC mean standard scores for the placebo and treatment groups at the 6-month visit. The ABC ranges from 20 to 160 and indicates low (20-70), moderately low (70-85), adequate (85-115), moderately high (115-130), or high (130-160) overall adaptive functioning.|The Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) is a cognitive test to measure cognitive ability and language development.

Difficulty with social interactions is characteristic of people with autism, who often have problems interpreting facial expressions or maintaining eye contact while talking with someone. There are currently no effective medicines available to treat social problems in individuals with autism. Neuropeptides, such as vasopressin and oxytocin, are molecules used by neurons in the brain to communicate with one another. Vasopressin is closely related to oxytocin, which is currently being tested as a treatment for autism, and has been shown to enhance social functioning in animals. Animal studies have shown that when the proper functioning of vasopressin is experimentally altered, animals develop a variety of social deficits, including impaired memory for peers and a reduced interest in social interaction. Researchers found that when vasopressin was administered to mice with a genetically induced form of autism, their social functioning improved. Vasopressin is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in humans, and has proved to be a successful treatment for some common pediatric conditions, including bedwetting. Similar to oxytocin, it also has been shown to improve social cognition and memory in people who do not have autism. The researchers will test the effects of vasopressin on social impairments in 50 boys and girls with autism, ages 6 to 12 years old. The study will last four weeks for each participant. Participants will receive either vasopressin or a placebo nasal spray. At the end of this phase of the study, those who received the placebo will have the option of participating in a four-week trial during which they will be given vasopressin.

Oxytocin (OT) is a neurohormone involved in both repetitive/rigid and social behaviors. This study is focusing on how a single dose of intranasal OT (IN-OT) affects cognitive rigidity and social perception tasks. Taking OT as a spray through the nose increases social and decreases repetitive behavior in some adults with ASD, and we are exploring if it helps children with ASD similarly. However, it is unclear whether every person with ASD has an abnormal OT level, and if OT affects restrictive or social behavior differently. Consequently, we aim to study whether OT treatment can be effective in treating subgroups with specific features of ASD. We will use approaches utilizing both behavioral and physiological responses to clarify the role of OT in ASD. We will develop a deeper understanding of the range of social and rigid behaviors and use that information to identify persons with ASD who would benefit from OT treatment. Potential subjects will be asked if they want to participate in two sessions in our clinical laboratory where they will get either single dose IN-OT or placebo. After receiving the substance, they will be asked to do a handful of tasks while we monitor heart rate, eye movements, and collect baseline and post intranasal blood, urine and saliva.

Generally, mirror responses are larger upon the observation of actions accompanied by relevant information for the observer, such as direct eye contact from the actor. In other words, 'mirroring' is adaptively modulated according to the social salience of the observed actions (i.e. it is socially adaptive).||Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are known to endure difficulties with correctly recognizing eye contact as a communicative cue. Instead, they tend to experience eye contact as stressful and arousing. It is therefore hypothesized that, upon the observation of actions combined with salient gaze cues from the actor, these mirroring processes will not be adaptively modulated in participants with ASD.||As appropriate processing of eye contact is a key aspect of (non-verbal) communicative behavior, the investigator will investigate the efficacy of a single dose of intranasal oxytocin administration for enhancing socially-adaptive mirroring in ASD. Oxytocin is a neuropeptide that acts as a regulator social brain areas. On a behavioral level, it is known to enhance the saliency of observed social cues and to improve prosocial behavior. As such, it is regarded a promising intervention for alleviating the social and communicative deficits in ASD.","Inclusion Criteria:||Male|Young adults (between 18 - 35 y/o)|Right-handed|Official diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders (for ASD participants)||Exclusion Criteria:||Female|Left-handed|Any neuro(psycho)logical / psychiatric illness (for healthy controls)|Motor dysfunctions of the hands / arms|Any contradiction to TMS research as assessed with the TMS screening list: no metal objects in the body (e.g. pacemaker, coronary bypass clips, implants, medication pumps, ...), history of brain trauma in the past (e.g. meningitis, epilepsy, surgery, ...) or history of drug and/or alcohol abuse.",25.0,Actual,Male,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,No,Oxytocin (OXT) spray|Placebo (PL) spray,A single dose (24IU) of nasal spray (3 puffs of 4IU per nostril) will be administered before the assessment of the neurophysiological measures.|A single dose (24IU) of nasal spray (3 puffs of 4IU per nostril) will be administered before the assessment of the neurophysiological measures.,Oxytocin|Placebo,Drug|Other,"February 5, 2020",Actual,"February 3, 2020",OTHER,KU Leuven,Leuven,Belgium,Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,687,,35 Years,18 Years,To Mirror or Not to Mirror Upon Perceived Eye Contact?

ASD is defined by impairments in social-communication as well as the presence of restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. ASD is frequently associated with co-occurring language delays. Currently the only well-accepted treatment for core ASD symptoms is behavior therapy such as Applied Behavioral Analysis and Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention. There is no US Food and Drug Administration approved medical therapy that addresses core ASD symptoms or the pathophysiological processes that underlie ASD.||The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a liquid form of leucovorin calcium on social and communication impairments in very young children with ASD. Participants entered into the trial will have delayed language and moderate ASD symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that leucovorin calcium will significantly improve social communication as well as core and associated behavioral symptoms of ASD, and be well-tolerated with no significant adverse effects, in young children with ASD.||To assess whether the liquid form of leucovorin calcium is superior to placebo, the investigators will study 80 children across two sites, between the ages of 2.5 and 5 years, with confirmed ASD and known social and communication delays at baseline. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive active treatment or placebo for 12 weeks under double-blind conditions. At the end of 12 weeks, all participants will receive active treatment for 12 weeks. Language skills and social communication abilities will be measured at screening and after each treatment arm in order to determine if the supplement positively influences social communication. Additionally, the investigators will measure changes in neural pathways using either magnetoencephalography at Phoenix Children's Hospital or functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy at State University of New York, Downstate. While these measures will be considered exploratory, they will be important to begin to elucidate the neuronal mechanisms underlying leucovorin's impact.","Inclusion Criteria:||1.

Two teaspoons of blood will be drawn each time. The urine sample will be analyzed in order to assess kidney function and to screen for the presence of drugs (such as cocaine, marijuana, heroin, etc.).

A number of researchers have suggested that the neuropeptide oxytocin may be implicated in the etiology of autism.||Given the likely possibility of dysregulated oxytocin in autism, the goal of this pilot study is to investigate the long-term therapeutic effects of oxytocin in the treatment of autism. One practical issue with oxytocin is that it does not exist in a pill form. Only the intravenous form is available in the United States and this form may or may not pass the blood-brain barrier. In addition, intravenous oxytocin is not practical for treatment studies. One alternative is intranasal oxytocin; this form of administration is known to pass the blood-brain barrier, and it is easy for participants to self-administer. Although not available in the United States, we are in the process of receiving an Investigational New Drug exemption for its use and can import it from Europe.||Thus, this pilot investigation will explore daily intranasal oxytocin in the treatment of autism. Also, there are very few, if any, outcome measures to assess social functioning in the ""real world"" in the context of clinical trials; yet, this is a major target for intervention, especially in autism. Thus, a final goal of this study will be to explore the use of Event Contingent Recording to index changes in social functioning and affect. Event Contingent Recording is a methodology developed by personality/social psychologists, which allows participants to report on symptoms, affect, and behavior close in time to experience. In addition, to enabling more sensitive assessments, this methodology allows for the assessment of more diverse (e.g., at home versus work) and more detailed measurements of mood and behavior.||Finally, a portion of this study aims to perform gene expression profiling using fresh whole blood to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying oxytocin therapy and oxytocin efficacy in adults with high functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome. The systemic effects of oxytocin therapy and the molecular basis for a positive treatment response to oxytocin are not well understood. An understanding of the former may help predict those persons who may suffer side-effects from treatment and the latter may help provide easily accessible peripheral biomarkers that could predict treatment response.","Inclusion Criteria:||Male or female outpatients 18 to 60 years of age.|Meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision.

808,808,809,NCT00376194,,,,,,"This study will examine whether DMSA, an oral chelating agent that removes mercury and other metals from the body, is beneficial for children with autism. DMSA is commonly used to treat autism, although it has never been tested in a controlled study and there is no proof that it helps children with the disorder. Support for its use is based on single-case reports of benefits of chelation with DMSA. This study will help determine whether or not DMSA is useful for treating autism.||Children between 4 and 10 years of age with autism spectrum disorder who weigh at least 33 pounds, who have detectable, but not toxic, levels of mercury or lead in the blood, and who have not previously received chelation therapy may be eligible for this study.||Participants complete a medical history, behavioral and psychological assessment and physical examination. Blood, hair, urine and stool samples are collected for testing.||Because DMSA can remove minerals the body needs, such as zinc and iron, as well as the toxic lead and mercury, participants take a daily multivitamin supplement starting 1 month before beginning chelation therapy and continuing for the duration of treatment. After 1 month of the supplementation regimen, the children are assigned to receive DMSA or placebo for 12 weeks, divided into six 2-week cycles. They take the assigned drug 3 times a day on days 1, 2 and 3 of each cycle and continue the multivitamin every day.||The children are seen in the clinic immediately before and after the first, third and sixth cycles. At each checkup, the parent or guardian answers a set of questions about the child's autism symptoms, physical health and medication side effects. Blood, urine and stool samples are collected for laboratory testing.||...",Mercury Chelation to Treat Autism,,,March 2007,,"Autism|Asperger's Disorder|Child Development Disorders, Pervasive","Autism|Autism Spectrum Disorder|Child Development Disorders, Pervasive|Child Development Disorders|Asperger's Disorder",Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Double,Treatment,,809,"Chelation of metals is widely used in the community to treat individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), with some surveys estimating that 1 in 12 children with autism have undergone chelation. This widespread use reflects the hypothesis that many cases of ASD are caused by exposure to thimerosal, an ethylmercury-based compound used previously in the US as a vaccine preservative for routine childhood immunizations. The prevalent use of chelation therapy stands in stark contrast with the lack of scientific or clinical evidence of efficacy, and creates a public health imperative for empiric data. Thus we propose a controlled trial of the effects of chelation on the core behavioral symptoms and overall functioning of children with ASD. The present investigation is a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study of the oral chelating agent meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA; succimer) among 120 children, ages four to ten years, who meet criteria for ASD. Pre- and post-treatment behavioral ratings will be used to evaluate the efficacy of chelation. In addition, children will undergo comprehensive medical history, physical examination and laboratory analyses.||Our objective is to quantify differences in behavioral functioning between the chelation treatment group and the placebo control group. Analysis of mercury levels before and during the course of treatment will be used to confirm the expected DMSA-induced excretion of mercury and to identify differences among children in the extent of excretion. Our primary hypothesis is that, on average and relative to the control group, children with ASD who undergo chelation with DMSA will show greater improvements in communication and social behavior.","INCLUSION CRITERIA:||Subjects may be included in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria:||Male or female subjects, four to ten years of age.|Meets research criteria for ASD (specifically, autism, Asperger Disorder, or Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified).|Detectable (greater than 0.1 microgram per deciliter) levels of blood lead and/or blood mercury.|Each legal guardian must have a level of understanding sufficient to agree to all required tests and examinations.

Prior studies have found that children with autism have deficiencies in key metabolites and antioxidants which can be caused by methyl B12 deficiency; additional studies have shown that methyl B12 normalizes deficiencies in these metabolites and antioxidants. Based on these reports, a pilot study was conducted at UC Davis on the effect of methyl B12 on the behavioral and metabolic measures in children with autism. The preliminary results of 29 subjects revealed a subgroup of 9 responders to clinical behavior assessments. These responders also demonstrated significant improvement on the plasma measures of antioxidant capacity, suggesting methyl B12 improves symptoms in a subgroup of children with autism by increasing key antioxidants. The current study will have an 8 week double blind design with 50 subjects, designed to evaluate improvements from methyl B12 by using behavioral assessments and analysis of specific metabolites in the subjects' blood. This study will determine whether methyl B12 will lead to benefits in any of the core features of autism, and will examine metabolic changes with the hope of potentially identifying a biomarker for treatment response in a subgroup of subjects.","Inclusion Criteria:||Diagnosis of DSM IV defined autism and meets cut off on Autism Diagnostic Inventory-Revised (ADI-R) and/or the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS)|Age 3 through 7 years|IQ of 50 or above|Parental agreement to continue present dietary, behavioral or psychotropic drug treatment but not change treatment during 8 week intervention|Willingness to have blood drawn, without the use of a sedative prescription from the study doctor||Exclusion Criteria:||Bleeding disorder|Cancer|Seizure disorder|Fragile X or other known genetic cause of autism|Perinatal brain injury (i.e.: cerebral palsy)|Other serious medical illnesses|Current use of any B12 supplement",57.0,Actual,All,No,,Active|Placebo,75 µg/Kg subcutaneously injected once every 3 days|placebo,Methyl B12|Placebo,Drug|Dietary Supplement,"February 24, 2017",Actual,"January 4, 2017",OTHER,"University of California, San Francisco",San Francisco,United States,UCSF,828,California,7 Years,3 Years,Double Blind Placebo Controlled Trial of Methyl B12 on Behavioral and Metabolic Measures in Children With Autism,"University of California, San Francisco","University of California, San Francisco",Completed,No,Phase 2|Phase 3,October 2013,Actual,"PI assesses subject's change using the CGI-I measure.

In addition, this reduction in nocturnal melatonin was significantly associated with the severity of communication and social interaction impairments, especially in verbal communication and play. Finally, diurnal excretion of melatonin was also found to be decreased in individuals with autistic disorder.||Given these results, administration of melatonin could serve, at least in prepubertal children wih autism, to normalize physiological, developmental and behavioral processes that are influenced by this pineal hormone.

During the baseline period, cognitive and adaptive information will be collected. The participant will then be randomly assigned to propranolol (Phase A) or placebo (Phase B). The titration schedule will be flexible and the dose can be held steady for an extended period. Dose reduction to manage side effects are allowed at any time. Each week the family will complete behavioral forms online and meet with the study psychiatrist via telemedicine. Following the initial Phase (A or B), participants will undergo a washout period (whether propranolol or placebo). Then, they will crossover to the other Phase (A or B). Upon completion of the crossover phase, the study blind will be broken.

The core symptoms of ASD are deficits in social communication and the presence of repetitive and restricted behaviours and interests, including sensory anomalies. Currently, there are no effective medical treatments for the core symptoms of ASD, and families frequently use costly non evidence based interventions. Developing drugs for ASD has been challenging because of a limited understanding of its underlying pathophysiology(ies), and difficulties modelling it in vitro and in vivo.||A recent study from EU-AIMS reported, for the first time in ASD, that differences in E-I balance can be 'shifted' using a GABA acting drug (riluzole), and that abnormalities in functional connectivity can be 'normalised' by targeting E-I, even in adults. This offers promise that drugs targeting specific parts of the GABA pathway may improve symptoms.||The aim of the investigator's project is to conduct a double-blind Randomized Control Trial (RCT) focused on GABA/glutamate equilibrium, to assess the efficacy of a drug that targets core and/or comorbid symptoms in ASD.

Though recent research has revealed much about the genetic and neurobiological bases of FraX, knowledge about specific and effective treatments for affected individuals is lacking. Based on information from both human and animal studies, one cause of intellectual disability in FraX may be related to deficits in a particular brain neurotransmitter system (the ""cholinergic"" system). Thus, the investigators propose to use a specific medication, donepezil, to augment cholinergic system in adolescents affected by FraX. If found to be effective, the knowledge generated by this research may also be relevant to other developmental disorders that share common disease pathways with FraX.",Randomized Controlled Study of Donepezil in Fragile X Syndrome,,,December 2013,Actual,Fragile X Syndrome,Syndrome|Fragile X Syndrome|Fragile X Syndrome,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Quadruple,Treatment,Participant|Care Provider|Investigator|Outcomes Assessor,919,"Fragile X syndrome (FraX), a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations of the FMR1 gene, is the most common known heritable cause of cognitive and behavioral disability in humans. Though research progress pertaining to FraX has been extraordinary in many areas, many critical gaps in knowledge remain. In particular, there is a dearth of information on treatments designed to address the often-serious cognitive and behavioral symptoms of FraX. Like many other developmental disorders, descriptions of treatments for FraX that do exist in the literature are primarily derived from uncontrolled case studies or series, with both pharmacological and behavioral interventions targeted to symptoms associated with phenomenologically defined ""co-morbid"" diagnoses such as AD/HD, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or anxiety disorders. These circumstances are suboptimal as such symptom-based treatments represent a low level of specificity with respect to the underlying pathogenesis of cognitive and behavioral problems. Accordingly, new research to develop more effective, disease-specific treatments for persons with FraX is greatly needed.||Converging evidence from our research group and others strongly support a hypothesis of functional cholinergic deficits contributing to cognitive-behavioral dysfunction in FraX. This evidence includes: (1) abnormalities of cholinergic pathway function and neurochemistry observed with functional MRI and 1H-MRS, respectively, in FraX, (2) an analysis of FMR1 expression during human fetal development indicating particularly high expression in cholinergic brain regions, (3) cholinergic system abnormalities detected in the mouse and fly models of FraX, (4) an analysis of the specific profile of cognitive and behavioral deficits in FraX in relation to current knowledge of cholinergic system functions, and, (5) significant improvements in cognition and behavior observed in 12 individuals with FraX during an open-label trial of donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor. Accordingly, the proposed project will consist of a double blind, placebo controlled trial of donepezil in 50 individuals with FraX, ages 12 to 29 years. The primary hypothesis is that subjects receiving donepezil will show greater improvements in specific measures of behavior and cognition, relative to the placebo group. In addition to direct benefit to persons affected by FraX, findings from the proposed research are likely to be highly relevant to subgroups of (currently) idiopathic developmental disorders, such as autism, that might share common pathophysiological mechanisms of disease with FraX. Such shared mechanisms could occur through intersecting pathways involving FMR1 protein function or as a result of similarities in the contribution of cholinergic dysfunction to cognitive and behavioral disability.","Inclusion Criteria:||confirmed genetic diagnosis of fragile X syndrome|age >=12, <=29|Verbal IQ >= 50, <=75|Tanner pubertal stage >= 3||Exclusion Criteria:||Current or lifetime DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychotic disorder, NOS based upon reported history|Poorly controlled seizure disorder or taking more than one anticonvulsant (subjects cannot be prescribed carbamazepine, phenytoin, or phenobarbital due to potential interaction effects with donepezil).

These changes have been recorded in 38% of autistic children in a clinical survey and 83% in an observational study, respectively. The cellular basis for this ""fever effect"" is unknown but is likely to involve heat shock proteins (HSP) and cellular stress responses (CSR) that lead to changes in synaptic function and network connectivity.||Sulforaphane (1-isothiocyanato-4R- (methylsulfinyl)butane) is an isothiocyanate that is delivered by lyophilized extracts of 3-day-old broccoli sprouts. Broccoli sprouts are widely consumed as a food item all over the world by very large numbers of individuals, without any reports of adverse effects. Our preliminary work in vitro shows that sulforaphane stimulates HSP and mitochondrial biogenesis in several genetic disorders.||This study of sulforaphane-rich Broccoli Sprout Extract in autism is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase II single site trial, designed to ensure safety and obtain efficacy data, with a focus on changes in social responsiveness, a core feature of autism. Its hybrid design, incorporating double masking, placebo control, and randomization, enhances the robustness of early outcome data. The study duration will be 2 years. Recruitment of subjects will be 50% by 8 months and complete by 14 months. All subjects in the study will be followed for 22 weeks. Treatment (18 weeks) will be started as patients are entered into the study and receive baseline testing.

The 2:1 randomization schedule will be produced by the study statistician using permuted random blocks and stratification by history of positive behavioral effects of fever. Treatment assignments will be performed by the research pharmacy at MGH. Females will be excluded for homogeneity of the sample and because males have higher incidence of autism than females (4:1). We will seek to enroll up to 50% of the subjects having a history of positive behavioral effects of fever, which will be recorded from caregivers' recall of incidents and graded on the CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) 7-point scale.||There will be in total 7 study visits for each subject: the screening visit, enrollment visit, a blood draw visit at 24 hours after the first dose of study medication (for mitochondrial/heat shock protein analysis), 4 week (follow-up) visit, 10 week (follow-up) visit, 18 week visit (last treatment visit), and the final closeout visit one month after the study drug stops (22 weeks).

The population prevalence of autism is approximately 1 in 1000 (GILLBERG and WING, 1999) and the ratio of affected males to females is 4:1 (FOMBONNE, 1999). Although typically considered a childhood disorder, most persons with autism experience marked functional impairment throughout their lives. Follow-up studies of children with autism show that only 5%-10% become independent as adults, 25% progress but still require supervision, and the remaining continue to be severely impaired and in need of institutionalized care (WING, 1989). Thus, the syndrome represents a substantial public health problem with tragic cost to the individual, the family, and the community.||It is a randomized, double blind flexible dose study with parallel groups, controlled, fluoxetine versus placebo.||The final efficacy evaluation will be done after 6 months of treatment; Nine obligatory visits are planned Patients will be assessed at the following visits: base-line inclusion (D-15), and 2, 4, ,12, ,20, 22, 24 25, 26 weeks.

In addition, an anatomical and functional MRI will be performed in all children, the same day. Brain imaging studies will be performed at the Service HOSPITALIER Frederic JOLIOT (ORSAY, France) under Dr Monica ZILBOVICIUS responsibility.||Each brain imaging examination will be performed twice: 1) at time zero (T0) - before the beginning of the treatment and 2) six month later, after placebo or sertraline treatment.||Functional imaging in the resting state - Positron emission tomography :||Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) will be measured on a Siemens ECAT HR+ camera. Attenuation-corrected data are reconstructed into 63 slices, with a resulting resolution of 4.5 mm full-width-at-half-maximum. Fifteen seconds before each scan, 7 mCi of H215O is administrated by bolus injection. Data are collected during 80 s. All rCBF examinations will be performed at rest during sleep induced by premedication (4 mg/kg of pentobarbital). We have previously reported that this premedication has no effects on absolute rCBF values and regional distribution.||Anatomical MRI:||A high resolution MRI of the brain will be obtained in all children witg a 1.5 Tesla Signa General Electric scanner using a 3D T1-weighted FSPGR sequence (TR/TE/TI/NEX: 10.5/2.2/600/1, flip angle 10°, matrix size 256 x 192, yielding 124 axial slices and a thickness of 1.2 mm, field of view 22 cm).

In addition, FLAIR and T2 axial and coronal sequences will be also acquired.||Biological measures:||Blood sample procedure for whole blood serotonin: patients must follow a diet poor in tryptophan during two days before the blood sampling. Blood sample will be performed without premedication between nine and 11 AM. Blood will be withdrawn into tubes containing EDTA acid and aprotinin.

Approximately 10 Canadian children per 10 000 live births suffer from the disorder, which is three to four times more common in males than in females. It is characterized by social and and communicative deficits and restricted, repetitive interests and behaviours. Most autistic children are delayed in the acquisition of both verbal and non-verbal communication skills and many never develop useful language. Three-quarters of autistic children have mild to severe mental retardation and a quarter develop seizures during later childhood or adolescence. Its etiology is heterogenous and there is no cure.

Currently, there is no FDA approved medical therapy that addresses either core ASD symptoms or pathophysiological processes associated with ASD. For example, the two FDA approved antipsychotic medications for treating ASD are indicated for symptoms associated with ASD, not core ASD symptoms. Based on strong preliminary evidence, this study aims to improve core ASD symptoms with folinic acid. Two biological mechanisms for response to the intervention are proposed and investigated in this study.||Folate is an essential B vitamin required for normal neurodevelopment. Folinic acid is a reduced form of folate that has been shown to improve both the metabolic and core symptoms associated with ASD in an open-label study and large case-series. This study will extend this preliminary evidence to demonstrate clinical efficacy of folinic acid in a double-blind placebo-controlled manner while also evaluating the biological mechanisms associated with the clinical response.||Preliminary evidence for the efficacy of folinic acid is two-fold: First, several independent studies have demonstrated that a folinic acid intervention improves ASD core symptoms in ASD patients diagnosed with cerebral folate deficiency - a metabolic disorder in which the primary pathway for the transport of folate across the blood-brain barrier is dysfunctional. The primary transport pathway for folate across the blood-brain barrier uses the folate receptor α (FRα) and energy dependent endocytosis. A secondary pathway, the reduced folate carrier (RFC), can transport reduced forms of folate, such as folinic acid, across the blood-brain barrier. In case-series of children with ASD and cerebral folate deficiency, folinic acid (0.5 to 2 mg/kg/day) improved communication, social interaction, attention, and stereotypical behavior in some (3-6) and completely ameliorated ASD symptoms in others (6, 7).||The major cause of cerebral folate deficiency is an autoantibody that binds to the FRα and interferes with its ability to bind and transport folate. Recently, Frye et al. found that (a) autoantibodies to the FRα were present in approximately 75% of children with ASD, and (b) an intervention with folinic acid (2mg/kg/day; max 50mg) in children with ASD and FRα autoantibodies resulted in significant improvements in parental ratings of receptive and expressive language, verbal communication, stereotypic behavior, and attention as compared to parental rating for children that did not undergo any intervention (wait group) over a similar time period. This proposal will extend these preliminary findings by documenting response to a folinic acid intervention in a double-blind placebo-controlled manner and test whether FRα autoantibody titers predict response to a folinic acid intervention. If FRα autoantibody titers are found to predict response to the intervention, such titers could provide a biomarker to identify a subset of children with ASD that may benefit from a folinic acid intervention and may even predict the development of ASD symptoms in high risk siblings during the presymptomatic period.||Second, the ratio of reduced-to-oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) is an established measure of systemic redox status and oxidative stress that has been shown in three independent case-control studies to be significantly decreased in many ASD children. James et al. have shown in a 3 month open-label clinical trial that an intervention of folinic acid and methyl-B12 significantly improved GSH/GSSG and Vineland scores for expressive language, receptive language, and socialization in ASD children. Important unanswered questions are (a) whether this preliminary data can be confirmed in a larger double-blind placebo-controlled study, (b) whether redox status before the folinic acid intervention can predict response to intervention and (c) whether improved systemic redox status is associated with improvement in core ASD symptoms.||This study will assess whether a folinic acid intervention can improve both core symptoms of ASD (i.e., communication, socialization, stereotyped movements) and associated comorbid symptoms (i.e., attention) in a double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial. This study will address whether improvements in core ASD symptoms associated with the intervention are related to biomarkers of either (or both) biological mechanisms proposed to be influenced by the intervention (i.e., GSH/GSSG, FRα autoantibody titer). Thus, using these biomarkers, it may be possible that children with ASD who optimally respond to the folinic acid intervention can be readily identified early after diagnosis or even during the pre-symptomatic period.||This double blind, placebo-controlled (DBPC) study will evaluate the efficacy of Folinic Acid for the treatment of language impaired autism spectrum disorder patients aged 3-14 years. The study will consist of a single site trial with approximatley 48 entering the DBPC phase. Subjects will be male or female with current or prospective diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Language Impairments will be defined by the CELF, or PLS when warranted.||Phase 1 will consist of approximately 57children aged 3-14 with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (as defined by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule or the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised), until approximately 48 children with confirmed ASD are enrolled into a randomized control trial (RCT; Phase 2). Enrollment will continue as needed until approximately 43 complete Phase 2. Approximately 40 will enroll into phase 3.||Initial analyses will be undertaken to inspect data for errors, inconsistencies, and incomplete information. This will include examining the data with simple frequency tables and dot plots for univariate data and scatter plots and multi-way dot plots with bivariate and multivariate data. To summarize bivariate relationships among predictors and between predictors and outcomes, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient will be used. For reporting inferential statistics, regression coefficients along with the 95 percent confidence intervals will be used extensively to quantify degree of clinical importance.||The primary population will be the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population and is defined as all subjects who have completed at least one post treatment primary outcome measure. A secondary analysis will be performed on the ""as treated"" population defined as those subjects who had at least 75% compliance of prescribed medications and have not significantly deviated from the protocol.||To determine whether the folinic acid intervention over a 12-week period improves core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder in Phase 2, the procedure Proc Mixed in SAS will be used to fit a mixed model analysis of covariance. For the multisite study, the full model with the response variable language assessment will include predictors such as: intervention, time, autoantibody, intervention by time interaction, autoantibody by intervention interaction, redox status, redox status by time interaction, and baseline covariates. However, for the single site study, the number of variables in the model will be limited due to the smaller sample size and separate models will be performed on subgroups to compare the effects of the treatment in various subgroups. The results from the mixed model will determine if the biomarkers of physiological abnormalities, both autoantibodies and redox status, predict intervention response. Similar analysis will be performed for the secondary outcomes.","Inclusion Criteria||1.

Overall, this study aims to determine the tolerability, accessibility, and feasibility of an oxytocin pilot study.||This study will consent up to 30 subjects in order to randomize up to 25 subjects into a 2-month (8 weeks) randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled initial treatment period, a subsequent 2-month (8 weeks) period in which all participants receive oxytocin, and up to three post-treatment visits that occur at week 28 (±2 weeks),an interim visit anytime between week 16 and week 76 only for those patients who plan to start oxytocin on their own outside of study treatment and who will experience a lag time between week 16 (end of open label treatment) and when outside oxytocin treatment will begin, and some time before week 76. The investigators hope that this study will help to inform future study designs in determining whether a short term or long term treatment trial is necessary to observe significant effects. This will also help to develop systematic preliminary safety measures.","Inclusion Criteria:||Between 3 and 17 years old, inclusive.|Have a clinical diagnosis of autistic disorder confirmed according to Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV criteria by using the Autism Diagnostic Interview - Revised (ADI-R) and/or the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS, Lord et al., 1989).||Exclusion Criteria:||Changes in allied health therapies, behavioral or educational interventions within the past 2 months of the baseline visit other than those associated with school holidays.|Changes in psychotropic and alternative medication doses in the last 30 days of the baseline visit.|Subjects with a medical condition that might interfere with the conduct of the study, confound interpretation of the study results, or endanger their own well-being.

Each subject will be administered the placebo nasal spray at Stanford University and then their parent will continue administering the nasal spray to the subject for 1 week at home. Each subject will then be randomly assigned either to the active group or to the placebo (stratified by gender) and will be given the appropriate nasal spray bottle and their parents will be responsible for administering 3 puffs per nostril (4 IU/puff) to their child for a total dose of 24 IU oxytocin or placebo twice daily (BID; morning and evening) for 4-weeks.

It is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum which affects an estimated 1 in 88 children in the United States. At present, pharmacotherapies target only associated features of autism, with no effective drug treatments for the social impairments. Several lines of evidence now suggest that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) may be an effective treatment for the core social deficits in autism. Here we will test the effects of twice daily intranasal OT (24 IU) over a 4-week period for enhancing social deficits in male and female children aged 6-12 years with autism. This research has high potential to lead to the development of more effective treatments and earlier interventions for children with autism.",Intranasal Oxytocin Treatment for Social Deficits in Children With Autism,,,May 2016,Actual,Autism,Autism,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Quadruple,Treatment,Participant|Care Provider|Investigator|Outcomes Assessor,1033,"In recent years, the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has been implicated in a wide range of social behaviors including attachment bonds, emotion recognition, eye gaze to social cues, and memory for social information. Social impairments represent one of the most intractable features of autism, and evidence now suggests that OT biology is dysregulated in individuals with this disorder. The central aim of the research outlined here is to test whether OT administration to children with autism increases their quality and quantity of social interactions and enhances their ability to process emotional and social information. Findings from initial single-dose OT administration studies in teenaged and adult males with autism have shown improvement in some aspects of social functioning, but replication and extension to well-controlled treatment trials with younger male and female subjects is necessary to evaluate effectiveness. We therefore aim to investigate the effect of intranasal OT on social cognition and behavior immediately following a single-dose (24IU) and following a 4-week period of OT (24IU BID) administration in a sample of 50 subjects with autism aged 6 to 12 years. The primary outcome for this study is change in social behavior, as determined by parent ratings on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) after the 4-week treatment period. Secondary outcomes are changes in functioning on laboratory-based measures of social behavior and cognition following single-dose and 4-week OT administration. Research in a small study sample (N=13) also identified treatment responders and non-responders to a single-dose of OT. Thus, we also aim to identify biological and cognitive and behavioral variables (i.e., pretreatment levels of social functioning and pretreatment plasma hormone levels) that may influence treatment response efficacy in our larger study sample. On completion of the 4-week treatment period all subjects will have the option of participating in another 4-week double-blind trial in which they will be switched to the alternate nasal spray to that which they previously received. They will then undergo a fourth and final assessment time-point using the same testing procedures as outlined above on completion of the 4-week dosing. By providing subjects with the option of participating in a second 4-week treatment trial, all subjects will have an opportunity to receive the active oxytocin nasal spray. We also will be able to examine any ongoing effects of oxytocin treatment in the group receiving placebo during the second 4-week administration period. Subjects not willing to take part in the second trial will exit the study and will be referred to their treating physician.","Inclusion Criteria:||Medically healthy outpatients between 6 and 12 years of age (cut off 12 years and 11 months)|Intelligence Quotient > 40|Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder based on the Autism Diagnostic Interview - Revised, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, and DSM-IV criteria|Clinical Global Impression severity rating of 4 or higher|Care provider who can reliably bring subject to clinic visits, provide trustworthy ratings, and interacts with the subject on a regular basis|Stable medications for at least 4 weeks|No planned changes in psychosocial interventions during the trial|Willingness to provide blood samples.||Exclusion Criteria:||Diagnostics and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychotic disorder|Regular nasal obstruction or nosebleeds|Active medical problems: unstable seizures, significant physical illness (e.g., serious liver, renal, or cardiac pathology)|Sensitivity to preservatives (in particular E 216, E 218, and chlorobutanol hemihydrate)|A genetic abnormality (e.g., Fragile X Syndrome)|Significant hearing or vision impairments|Habitually drinks large volumes of water|Pregnancy, breastfeeding, or child birth within the last 6 months|Sexually active females not using a reliable method of contraception.",54.0,Actual,All,No,,Oxytocin nasal spray|Placebo nasal spray,24IU BID (3 x 0.1 mL [4IU] sprays per nostril twice daily for 4-weeks.|3 x 0.1 mL sprays per nostril twice daily for 4-weeks.,Oxytocin nasal spray|Placebo,Drug|Drug,"July 15, 2019",Actual,"July 12, 2019",OTHER,Stanford University,Stanford,United States,Stanford University School of Medicine,1033,California,12 Years,6 Years,"Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo Controlled Trial of Intranasal Oxytocin Treatment for Social Deficits in Children With Autism.",Stanford University,Stanford University|Stanford University,Completed,Yes,Phase 2,May 2016,Actual,Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) raw scores measure social abilities with lower raw scores meaning better social abilities.

A wide range of symptoms accompany autism, including self-injurious behavior, aggression, and severe tantrums. Despite an improved ability to reduce these symptoms, existing drug treatments continue to be associated with adverse side effects. Also, there is no existing drug treatment that reliably improves social behavior, a core deficit in autism. Studies on drug treatment combinations that are designed to reduce self-injurious behavior, aggression, and severe tantrums and improve social behavior in children with autism have yet to be conducted. This study will address the above-mentioned limitations by evaluating aripiprazole in reducing self-injurious behavior, aggression, and severe tantrums and by evaluating the addition of D-Cycloserine in improving social behavior among children with autism.||This study will include three phases and an add-on component for some children. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either aripiprazole or a placebo treatment for 8 weeks. Assessments measuring irritability, behavior, and social skills will be conducted at the end of this first phase. Those patients who respond well to aripiprazole will continue to receive aripiprazole treatment for another 16 weeks. This second phase will determine whether aripiprazole is associated with long-term maintenance of symptomatic improvement in patients who respond well to short-term treatment. Assessments will again be conducted at the end of this 16-week period. Those patients whose symptoms have stabilized and continue to improve while on aripiprazole will be asked to participate in the final phase of this study. During the this pilot phase, D-Cycloserine will be added to ongoing treatment with aripiprazole. Patients will take both aripiprazole and D-Cycloserine for an additional 8 weeks to determine if this combination of drug treatments results in improved social behavior once patients' aggression and self-injurious behavior have been stabilized with aripiprazole. At the end of this 8-week period, participants will be assessed for any changes in behavior, irritability, or social skills. Results from this study may aid in developing safer and more effective drug treatments for children and adolescents with autism.","Inclusion Criteria:||Weight of at least 15 kg (33.75 lbs)|Meets DSM-IV criteria for autistic disorder|Outpatient|Medication-free for at least 2 weeks prior to baseline for all psychotropic medications.

Examination of whether changes in the activity of key pathways/proteins influenced by fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) (the mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) and MMP-9) are biomarkers of treatment responsiveness. Because lovastatin is also an anti-inflammatory, characterization of MEK/ERK signaling in peripheral immune cells both pre- and post- treatment will be carried out to determine whether levels of these signaling molecules are predictive biomarkers of treatment response.

While most research has attempted to treat the behavioral deficits commonly associated with ASD, few studies have attempted to improve the core features of this disorder. A recent study found that donepezil HCl helped to improve speech production, attention span, and ability to express emotions in a group of children with autism. This study will provide an opportunity to conduct further testing of the effects of donepezil HCl on the cognitive deficits presumed to underlie the core features of ASD.||This study begins at Week 1 with a baseline assessment. Participants are then randomly assigned to either donepezil HCl or placebo. Participants will start with either a 5mg/day dose of donepezil HCl or placebo followed by a cognitive assessment after 4 weeks on this dose.

Its presentation during childhood is similar to that seen in adulthood, except that children sometimes lack insight into the senselessness of the thoughts and behaviors. Although many patients benefit from treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a significant proportion have limited or no response to these medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may also be effective for OCD, alone or in combination with SSRIs, but there is a shortage of qualified therapists, and many patients and families cannot participate effectively in the therapy.||There is a pressing need, then, for the development of alternative, novel treatments for pediatric OCD. Neuropsychological and neuroimaging data suggest that OCD may arise from dysfunction of orbitofronto-striato-thalamocortical circuitry. Glutamate plays a crucial role in the regulation of excitatory activity within this circuit and may be involved in the etiopathogenesis of OCD. If so, then agents which reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission may provide unique antiobsessional benefits. Riluzole is a medication that reduces glutamatergic activity. A small open-label trial suggested that it might reduce OCD severity among children and adolescents.||The investigation will enroll up to 80 pediatric subjects with OCD including some who have both autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) and OCD. The subjects will participate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week trial of riluzole as a sole agent or as an augmentation to their currently inadequate therapy. Following the double-blind portion of the trial, subjects may receive three months of open-label treatment with riluzole, if it is clinically indicated.

Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) does not specifically allow for a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD with ASD, many children with an ASD manifest symptoms of ADHD and are treated for it with stimulants or other medication. The few studies on ADHD in ASD have not consistently established its cognitive and behavioral manifestations, or the optimal parameters for treatment. The proposed project will address these issues through studies of cognitive and behavioral functioning in children with ASD, with and without ADHD, and through a study of medication treatment of ADHD symptoms in autism.||Participants between the ages of 7 to 12 with an autism spectrum disorder participated in the initial phase of the study to examine the nature and effects of ADHD symptoms on behavioral and cognitive functioning. Participants underwent an initial psychological testing session that included standardized measures of intellectual, adaptive behavior, language, behavioral, and emotional functioning, along with standardized diagnostic measures to confirm their diagnoses of ASD and/or ADHD (Visit 1). Children with intelligence quotients (IQs) below 50 or greater than 130 or with major sensory, motor, neurological, genetic, or psychiatric disorders that may interfere with testing were be excluded. The participants who meet eligibility criteria completed computerized tasks of attentional functioning in a second visit (Visit 2).||A subset of the children meeting criteria for the ASD/ADHD group (N=24) participated in a six-week randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trial using various doses (low, medium, or high dose) of methylphenidate (MPH). Children participated in the treatment trial will be those who qualified based on the initial phase and who do not have any physical contraindications to MPH (e.g., history of MPH intolerance). In each week of the treatment trial, the children took one of the three doses of MPH or a placebo. At the end of each week the child were evaluated in the clinic by including a medical check-up, parent interviews about the child's behavior and functioning that week, and computerized cognitive testing. Additionally, the child's parent and teacher completed questionnaires about the child's behavior each week, so that the child's home and school behaviors at each MPH dose could be assessed.","Inclusion Criteria:||Autism/ADHD Group:||DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder, as per the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)|Child manifests current symptoms of ADHD||Autism/non-ADHD Group:||Meets the diagnostic criteria for autism, as above, but does not meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD||Exclusion Criteria:||In both groups, exclusion criteria will include:||Sensory or motor deficits sufficient to interfere with testing (e.g., blindness, severe cerebral palsy)|Serious neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy, stroke)|Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome, Tourette syndrome, or fetal alcohol syndrome|Bipolar disorder or a family history of bipolar disorder in a first-degree relative|Other serious psychopathology that resulted in psychiatric hospitalization (e.g., for psychotic episode).

The central hypothesis of this project is that D-cycloserine will be efficacious in reducing certain symptoms of autism including some aspects of social impairment.||Autism is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder with a prevalence of at least 0.1 %. Despite investigations into the pharmacologic treatment of autism, no drugs have been shown to consistently improve the core symptoms of the disorder, namely social and communication impairment. Pilot data has suggested that D-cycloserine, a drug that affects the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor, has efficacy for the symptom of social withdrawal in autism. In this study, children with autism will be randomly assigned to treatment with either D-cycloserine or placebo for 8 weeks. Both the subjects and investigators will be blind to treatment assignment. Subjects will be rated on a variety of clinical measures to examine the effects of D-cycloserine on social withdrawal and other symptoms of autism. Safety data including side-effects, vital signs, blood tests, and electrocardiograms will be performed at the beginning and end of the study. This study will provide important information about the effects of D-cycloserine for treating core and associated symptoms of autism. It will also greatly expand the knowledge about glutamatergic agents in autism and provide crucial information regarding the pathophysiology and future design of drug studies in autism.","Inclusion Criteria:||Age 3 Years to 12 Years|Diagnostic Statistical Manual Version -IV (DSM-IV) and Autism Diagnostic Interview - Revised (ADI-R)-confirmed Diagnosis of Autistic Disorder|Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) Lethargy Subscale Score of 13 or greater||Exclusion Criteria:||Children with Severe to Profound Mental Retardation|Weight at Screening Visit <11 kilograms|Clinical Global Impressions-Severity Score of 7|Presence of a Neurodevelopmental Disorder with Possible Associations to Autism: Subjects with Fragile X Syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis, or other neurodevelopmental disorders known to be associated with autism or autistic features will be excluded.|Presence of a Psychiatric Disorder that would Require a Specific Type of Treatment: Subjects with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or a psychotic disorder will be excluded because treatment for these disorders often requires specific psychotropic agents.

This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of risperidone (0.02 to 0.06 mg/kg/day) compared with placebo in the treatment of behavioral symptoms in children 5 to 12 years of age with Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD). Patients receive study medication (risperidone or placebo) to be taken orally once a day at gradually increasing doses up to a maximum of 0.06 mg/kg, adjusted at weekly intervals to achieve optimal effectiveness while minimizing any intolerance to the drug. Treatment continues at the optimal dose through Week 8. A parent or caregiver evaluates the child's behavior and symptoms at scheduled office visits during the course of treatment. The primary measure of effectiveness is the change in the Irritability Subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and other ABC subscales at end of treatment compared with baseline. Additional assessments of effectiveness include: the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (N-CBRF); the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), a measure of the patient's most disturbing symptom; and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) of the overall severity of the disorder. Safety assessments include the incidence of adverse events throughout the study; measurement of vital signs (pulse, temperature, blood pressure), body weight, and evaluation of the presence and severity of extrapyramidal symptoms by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) at specified intervals; clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis) before study initiation and at the end of treatment. The study hypothesis is that risperidone is more effective than placebo for the treatment of behavioral symptoms in children aged 5 to 12 years with Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD). Risperidone oral solution 1 mg/mL or placebo, taken orally, once daily. Days 1 - 2, dose is 0.01 mg/kg body weight. Days 3 - 7 dose is 0.02 mg/kg, increasing on Days 8 - 14 to 0.04 mg/kg (maximum), and 0.06 mg/kg (maximum) through 8 weeks. Dosage may be adjusted at investigator's discretion.","Inclusion Criteria:||Diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorders (Autistic Disorder, Rett's Disorder, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, Asperger's Disorder, or Pervasive Development Disorder not Otherwise Specified) by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV), Axis I criteria|with a total score of >=30 on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS)|receiving treatment as an out-patient|healthy on the basis of a physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and medical history at start of the study.||Exclusion Criteria:||Diagnosis of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders by DSM-IV criteria|seizure during 3 months prior to study initiation or currently being treated with more than one anticonvulsant drug|history of tardive dyskinesia (a complication of neuroleptic therapy involving involuntary movements of facial muscles)|neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a rare psychotropic-drug reaction, which may be characterized by confusion, reduced consciousness, high fever or pronounced muscle stiffness)|known hypersensitivity, intolerance, or unresponsiveness to risperidone.",80.0,Actual,All,No,,,,risperidone,Drug,"January 24, 2011",Estimate,"January 20, 2011",INDUSTRY,"Janssen-Ortho Inc., Canada",,,,1162,,12 Years,5 Years,"Efficacy And Safety Of Risperidone In The Treatment Of Children With Autistic Disorder And Other Pervasive Developmental Disorders: A Canadian, Multicenter, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study","Janssen-Ortho Inc., Canada","Janssen-Ortho Inc., Canada",Completed,,Phase 3,,,,Change in the Irritability Subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and other ABC subscales at end of treatment compared with baseline,,"Shea S, Turgay A, Carroll A, Schulz M, Orlik H, Smith I, Dunbar F.

Seventy-five percent of children and adolescents with autistic disorder have irritability symptoms such as aggression towards others, deliberate self-injurious behavior, temper tantrums, and quickly changing moods. These symptoms affect their daily functioning such as school performance, interactions with family members and compliance to treatment. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic agent that has been recently approved for the treatment of irritability associated with Autistic Disorder in children and adolescents aged 5 to 16 years. The approved dose range is 0.5-3 mg per day. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness (change in level of irritability and related behaviors) of a lower dose (0.125 mg or 0.175 mg risperidone per day depending on body weight). The study will include three treatment groups. A placebo group, a low dose risperidone group and a higher dose risperidone group (1.25 mg or 1.75mg per day depending on body weight). This phase of the study will be 6 weeks. During the study, neither investigators nor the patients will be told which treatment the patient received. This is called ""double blind"". The placebo treatment is not expected to be effective. The higher dose group is expected to be effective. At the end of the study, data from the lower dose group will be compared to the placebo group to see if it is effective. Another aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of risperidone. At the end of the 6-week double-blind period, patients may enter a 6-month open-label period during which all patients will receive risperidone. During this phase of the study, the doses can be adjusted to a maximum of 1.25 mg or 1.75mg per day depending on body weight. Both investigator and the patient will know what dose the patient is taking. About 93 patients will be randomized. The study will be conducted by investigators from about 15 clinics. Assessments of effectiveness include the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) subscales including the irritability subscale (ABC-I), the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI C); the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S); the response rate, and the Compulsions Subscale of the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY BOCS). Safety evaluations include monitoring of adverse events, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, nighttime sleep quality and daytime drowsiness, and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) as assessed using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) and the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS). Venous blood samples will be collected for the determination of plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone. The study hypotheses are that the higher dose level of risperidone is significantly superior to placebo as measured by change from baseline on the ABC-I Subscale score at end point (Week 6 or early withdrawal) and that the lower dose level of risperidone is significantly superior to placebo as measured by change from baseline on the ABC-I Subscale score at end point (Week 6 or early withdrawal). Double-blind phase: Risperidone oral solutions taken once daily. Depending on body weight patients take 1.25 mL or 1.75 mL of either a 0.1 mg/mL or a 1.0 mg/mL risperidone solution or matching placebo, for 6 weeks. Open-label phase: Medication can be taken once or twice a day. Starting from 0.125mg or 0.175mg per day, drug levels are titrated over 2 weeks to a maximum dose level of 1.25 mg risperidone/day or 1.75 mg /day depending on body weight, for 26 weeks.","Inclusion Criteria:||DSM-IV diagnosis of Autistic Disorder (299.00)|ABC-I Subscale score of greater than or equal to 18|CGI-S of greater than or equal to 4|mental age >18 months, body weight of at least 20 kg, seizure-free for at least 6 consecutive months and if on anticonvulsants must be on a dosage that has been stable for at least 4 weeks|Medication free for 1 week before the start of the study for all psychotropic drugs, except 4 weeks for fluoxetine and at least 8 weeks for injectable medications|Female patients must be premenarchal or sexually abstinent or, if heterosexually active, must practice an effective method of birth control.||Exclusion Criteria:||History of prior or current DSM-IV psychotic disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, other psychosis), Pervasive Developmental Disorder not otherwise specified (PDD NOS), Asperger's, or Rett's|Any history of hypersensitivity to risperidone, or its excipients in formulation, or other known drug allergy|Patients who received risperidone within 3 months before screening (except p.r.n. use)|Patients who did not demonstrate sufficient clinical response to an adequate trial of risperidone treatment in the past (an adequate trial is defined as a period of at least 4 weeks at an adequate dose)|Neurologic disorder (e.g., Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome, seizure disorders that are unstable, seizure activity within the past 6 months)|History of alcohol or substance dependence within 3 months of screening|Female subject who is pregnant (positive beta-HCG) or breast feeding|Patients with existing moderate or severe EPS or history of tardive dyskinesia|Patients who have received an experimental drug or used an experimental medical device within 3 months before the planned start of treatment.",96.0,Actual,All,No,,003|002|001,Oral solution qd or bid for 6 weeks|Risperidone oral solution 1.25 mg (if <45 kg) or 1.75 mg (if >=45 kg) qd or bid for 6 weeks|Risperidone oral solution 0.125 mg (if <45 kg) or 0.175 mg (if >=45 kg) qd or bid for 6 weeks,Placebo|Risperidone high dose|Risperidone low dose,Drug|Drug|Drug,"May 9, 2014",Estimate,"April 24, 2014",INDUSTRY,"Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, L.L.C.",Dothan|Phoenix|Sacramento|Santa Ana|Boca Raton|Miami|Smyrna|Hoffman Estates|Naperville|Lake Charles|Bronx|Manhasset|New York|Staten Island|Columbus|Oklahoma City|Philadelphia|Houston|Fairfax|Portsmouth,United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States,,1164,Alabama|Arizona|California|California|Florida|Florida|Georgia|Illinois|Illinois|Louisiana|New York|New York|New York|New York|Ohio|Oklahoma|Pennsylvania|Texas|Virginia|Virginia,17 Years,5 Years,"Risperidone in the Treatment of Children and Adolescents With Autistic Disorder: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of Efficacy and Safety, Followed by an Open-Label Extension Study of Safety","Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, L.L.C.","Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, L.L.C.",Completed,No,Phase 4,September 2009,Actual,Measure of irritability symptoms of autism.

The primary aim of the treatment is to reduce impairing behavioral symptoms such as aggression, explosive outbursts, or self-injurious behavior, without significant side effects. A secondary aim is to evaluate possible improvement in the level of social relatedness, attention, motor coordination, and short-term memory.||This study is a placebo-controlled, double-blind study (neither the investigators nor patients know if the treatment being given is risperidone or an inactive substance, placebo). Patients will be asked to participate for 6 to 8 months. For the first 8 weeks, patients will receive either risperidone or placebo, randomly chosen. At the end of the 8 weeks, those patients who have improved and were on risperidone will be asked to continue on this medication for another 4 months. The last two months of the study are again double-blind (neither patients nor investigators know treatment).

Effective early treatments that account for ADHD symptoms have not been developed for young children with ASD+ADHD. The overarching goals of this randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2, pilot study are to (1) evaluate a novel early intervention that pharmacologically addresses ADHD symptoms while providing an ASD-targeted behavioral intervention, and (2) identify changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie improved outcomes in children with comorbid ASD and ADHD ages 3-10 years. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether a stimulant treatment augments efficacy of an ASD specific form of parent child therapy based on the Early Start Denver Model called ESDM influenced Parent Coaching. Secondary aims are to determine the efficacy of combined intervention in improving ADHD symptoms and the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Adzenys-XR-ODT in young children with ASD+ADHD. The study will also examine correlations between behavioral changes and state-of-the-art eye-gaze tracking (EGT) and electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers to elucidate key ways in which ADHD impacts attentional and neural functioning in ASD+ADHD, and to potentially identify new targets for intervention in children with ASD+ADHD. The study is about 8 months long and will involve screening, baseline assessment followed by 10- 11 weeks of study drug treatment (active or placebo) and 8 sessions of ESDM informed parent coaching beginning after 2 weeks of study drug treatment, primary endpoint assessments at ~11 weeks, AE follow-up by phone at ~week 13 and remote FU 24 weeks after baseline. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to the active medication or placebo, Between weeks 11 to 24, it is expected that the parent will use the behavioral strategies they were coached in even though they will not receive parent coaching.

It is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of metformin (also known as Glumetza, Glucophage, Fortamet), a type 2 diabetes medication that can also improve obesity and excessive appetite.||Metformin has emerged as a candidate drug for the targeted treatment of FXS based on animal studies showing rescue of multiple phenotypes in the FXS model. Metformin may contribute to normalizing signaling pathways in FXS in the central nervous system, which may include activities of mTOR and PI3K, both of which have shown to be pathogenically overactive in FXS. In addition, metformin inhibits phosphodiesterase, which would lead to correction of cAMP levels, and MMP9 production, which is also elevated in FXS. Looking at the potential signaling pathways, metformin appears to be a good candidate for targeting several of the intracellular functions in neurons disrupted in FXS and, therefore, has potential to rescue several types of symptoms in individuals with FXS. The researchers have utilized metformin in the clinical treatment of over 20 individuals with FXS between the ages of 4 and 58 years and have found the medication to be well tolerated and to provide benefits not only in lowering weight gain and normalizing appetite but also in language and behavior. In this controlled trial, the researchers hope to further assess metformin's safety and benefits in the areas of language and cognition, eating and weight loss, and overall behavior.||Each participant will be involved in this trial for a period of 4 months. This will include 3 visits to the UC Davis MIND Institute and 5 phone calls. At each visit, the researchers will assess behavioral, cognitive, and language development. The researchers will also assess the side effects of the study medication throughout the trial.||Study record updated 9/26/2018 to reflect the following IRB-approved protocol modifications: Erroneous references to ""digital"" books for primary outcome measure were removed, as this measure is administered using print (non-digital) materials.

While these measures do not appear to map directly onto caregiver-reported anxiety of the individuals level of anxiety, the results are consistent with high rates of social anxiety and sympathetic reactivity in FXS. Stimuli are presented on a Tobii T120 eye-tracker. The system has several benefits that make it conducive to testing individuals with developmental disorders. Stimuli consist of sixty colored photographs of adult human faces each showing a calm, happy, or fearful expression, and sixty scrambled versions of the face images.|Recently, researchers were able to obtain EEG recordings and ERP responses during an auditory oddball paradigm from patients with FXS enrolled in a controlled trial of minocycline. The study demonstrated the potential feasibility and sensitivity of ERPs as an indicator of cortical processing changes in a targeted treatment trial. It appears to provide a biomarker and measure for the human equivalent of cortical hyperexcitability. Additionally, we will administer a recently developed task looking at EEG habituation to pseudowords to assess word learning with EEG. Data is acquired using a Brainproducts Quickamp system. Raw data is imported into Brainvision Analyzer software for analysis. The continuous data is segmented according to the event type and filtered. We also analyze the EEG data at resting state for the oddball paradigm according to frequency distribution and the occurrence of spontaneous oscillations, and pseudoword habituation with ERP, energy and time-frequency analyses.|The Sensory Profile 2 family of assessments evaluates a child's sensory processing patterns in the context of everyday life. The forms are completed by caregivers, who are in the strongest position to observe the child's response to sensory interactions that occur throughout the day. The Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile was developed to assess sensory processing abilities in individuals beyond childhood. The Sensory Profile Adolescents/Adult is a self report, however, if the participant is unable to complete it themself, we will ask their caregiver to complete it and we will make note of who completed it. The French versions are the Profil sensoriel 2 and the Profil sensoriel-adolescent/adulte.","Change from baseline in the FXS-normed Aberrant Behavior Checklist - Community Edition (ABC-C)|Improvement of symptoms in FXS using the Clinical Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) scale|Change from baseline in the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)|Change from baseline in the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Third Edition (VABS-III) Adaptive Behavior Composite Score|Change from baseline in the Anxiety Depression and Mood Screen (ADAMS) overall score|Change from baseline in the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham Questionnaire (SNAP-IV) overall score|Change from baseline in the Pediatric Quality of Life Questionnaire (PedsQL) Parent Proxy overall score|Change from baseline in the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) overall score|Change from baseline in the Care Related Quality of Life (CarerQoL) overall score|Change from baseline in The Memory Game|Change from baseline in the Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) overall score|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox Picture Sequence Memory Test|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox Dimensional Change Card Sort Test|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox List Sorting Working Memory Test|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox Oral Reading Recognition Test|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox Picture Vocabulary Test|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox Speeded Matching Test|Change from baseline in Eye Tracking|Change from baseline in Event Related Potentials during the Auditory Oddball Paradigm and Pseudoword Paradigm|Change from baseline in the Sensory Profile-2 or Sensory Profile Adolescents/Adults","Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16","May 24, 2019",Actual,September 2021,Child|Adult,"March 5, 2019",Actual,"February 26, 2019","March 1, 2019",Interventional,"April 13, 2022",,Yes

At 3 months urine zymography will be performed to see if MMPs are present in urine at the prescribed dose. Doxycycline will be increased to 100 mg bd at three months after urine zymography has been performed. To avoid withholding treatment from those who decline rapidly, patients who, on two occasions, have either a fall from baseline FEV1 of 300 ml or fall in resting SaO2 of 3% will be assessed by an independent expert (AET). Patients receiving placebo will be given the option of doxycycline according to protocol. Those receiving doxycycline the option of continuing in the study or withdrawal. These patients and those withdrawn due to recurrent pneumothorax, increase in chylous effusion or bleeding angiomyolipoma will be included in a composite safety endpoint and analysed on an intention to treat basis.

The mean slope of regression lines for FEV1 and FVC, plus change DLCO, shuttle walk distance and QoL in the doxycycline and placebo groups will be compared by parametric or non-parametric analysis dependent on data, time to composite safety endpoint by Caplan-Meier analysis, complications and adverse events by Chi Square test.||1. Introduction||Lymphangioleiomyomatosis Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a disease of the lungs and lymphatics, which can occur sporadically or in association with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). The disease is rare, occurring in 1-2 / million of the population but in up to 40% of women with TSC LAM almost exclusively affects women, generally developing before the menopause. The disease is characterised by progressive pulmonary cystic change, recurrent pneumothorax, chylous pleural collections and, in most cases, progressive respiratory failure. Abdominal manifestations caused by obstruction and dilation of the axial lymphatics include lymphadenopathy, cystic lymphatic masses (lymphangioleiomyomas), chylous ascites and angiomyolipoma (a benign tumour). Survival in LAM is, 70 90% at 10 yrs, although this is highly variable since long-term survivors have been described. Diagnosis is made by a combination of clinical features and computed tomography scanning or, in cases of doubt, lung biopsy. In patients with rapidly progressive disease, hormone treatment (predominantly progesterone) has been used, although no firm evidence supports its use. Otherwise, treatment is aimed at complications including pneumothorax, chylous collections and extra-pulmonary manifestations. The only treatment for severe LAM is currently lung transplantation(Johnson 2006). Recently identification of abnormalities in the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) genes in sporadic and TSC associated LAM have identified dysregulation of the mTOR pathway in LAM (Carsillo, Astrinidis et al. 2000; Sato, Seyama et al. 2002) and have lead to clinical trials of mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin in LAM and TSC. At the time of writing these have not been reported but appear promising.||Background and preliminary data Cystic lung destruction is the hallmark of pulmonary LAM and generally results in respiratory failure over a variable period of time(Johnson 2006). Over-activity of proteases including elastase, trypsin and the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is responsible for parenchymal destruction in emphysema and other lung diseases. The MMPs are a family of zinc dependent proteolytic enzymes with proteolytic activities against extra-cellular matrix proteins. The MMPs are overexpressed in inflammatory and neoplastic diseases where in addition to processing extra-cellular matrix they also have roles in metastasis, angiogenesis, growth factor activation and inactivation(Stamenkovic 2003). MMPs -1, -2, and -9 are involved in the sequential digestion of collagen and gelatin and are strongly expressed in the walls of cysts where it is thought they contribute to parenchymal destruction in LAM(Matsui, Takeda et al. 2000). Further, MMPs can be detected by gelatin zymography in the urine of patients with LAM but not controls. Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic in common clinical use. In addition to its antimicrobial action it inhibits the synthesis and activity of several MMPs and inhibits proliferation of a range of cell types including arterial smooth muscle, cancer cells and cancer model systems(Bendeck, Conte et al. 2002; Duivenvoorden, Popovic et al. 2002; Onoda, Ono et al. 2004). In preliminary experiments we have demonstrated that primary LAM derived and angiomyolipoma cells produce MMP-2 and -7 and that MMP expression and proliferation in these cells in inhibited by doxycycline.||Preliminary clinical data of doxycycline in LAM In a preliminary open label study of doxycycline (50 - 100 mg qds) in 10 patients with LAM, doxycycline improved 6 minute walk distance) and Borg dyspnoea score (Glassberg et al. Data presented at the LAM Foundation International Research Conference, Cincinnati Ohio 2006). In a single case report, Moses et al. observed an improvement in FEV1 and oxygenation during exercise in a patient with LAM treated with 100mg doxycycline daily (Moses, Harper et al. 2006). In both of these cases MMP-2 and -9 were initially present in the patient's urine and was undetectable after treatment with doxycycline. In a study of 14 patients, doxycycline 100mg bd is known to give a mean plasma concentration of 4.41 µg/ml (range 1.9-9.4 µg/ml)(Prall, Longo et al. 2002).||Specific issues in orphan disease clinical trials and rationale for trial design Studying orphan diseases presents specific challenges, specifically the limited number of patients available, wide geographic distribution and low priority for funding due to the perceived poor economic benefit. Patients are well informed about potential developments due to patient groups and internet based information(Tattersfield and Glassberg 2006) and may obtain potential treatments 'off label' making definitive research studies impossible. As LAM is rare, cohorts drawn from a wide area are required for studies to achieve adequate power. We have 15 years experience of LAM research and from our UK LAM database estimate there are approximately 120 patients in the UK. We are currently performing an open label study of Sirolimus in LAM and tuberous sclerosis (TESSTAL, a Study of The Efficacy and Safety of Sirolimus (Rapamycin) Therapy for Renal Angiomyolipomas in Patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex And Sporadic Lymhangioleiomyomatosis). This included six patients with LAM whom we found to be well motivated and will travel long distances for study visits (including Cornwall, Kent and Perth). Despite the known adverse effects of rapamycin six of eight eligible (i.e. with LAM and angiomyolipoma) patients invited took part in the study. The current study protocol has been designed as a simple protocol which is both inclusive of most patients with LAM and has a follow up which is similar to routine clinical care which we hope will facilitate recruitment. In addition the protocol is less demanding than that of the TESSTAL study. As most patients are known to us via our database or clinical contacts we expect recruitment to be complete within six months.||Designing a definitive study is difficult without having an estimate of the likely size of effect, if this is large, as suggested by the one case report(Moses, Harper et al. 2006) a small number of patients are needed. If it is small as seems more likely a priori, a larger number of patients are needed requiring European collaboration and considerably greater funding. We therefore designed a pragmatic pilot study using a single geographic population with a simple, inexpensive protocol which will serve several functions, specifically to: (1) determine the optimum dose of doxycycline needed to suppress MMP production. (2) define the safety profile of doxycycline in LAM. (3) provide evidence of efficacy and size of effect. (4) provide data to help optimise the design and logistics of future trials.||2 Study aims/objectives||Hypothesis Doxycycline will prevent matrix metalloproteinase dependent tissue destruction in lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) thus preserving lung function, exercise capacity and quality of life.||We will perform a randomised placebo controlled trial of doxycycline on rate of decline of FEV1 over two years against matched placebo. This study will:||determine the optimum dose of doxycycline needed to suppress MMP production.|define the safety profile of doxycycline in LAM.|provide evidence for efficacy and size of effect.|provide data to help optimise the design and logistics of future trials.||With the data obtained we will be in a strong position to apply for European funding for a European wide trial should this still be required.||3 Investigational plan||Patient population and recruitment||Forty patients with either sporadic LAM or TSC-LAM will be recruited from the UK LAM database, physician referrals, LAM Action (a patients group for women with LAM) and the Tuberous Sclerosis Association. Patients will be contacted by mail by the principal investigator. Potential participants will receive a preliminary information sheet and response sheet for return by prepaid post. Those that express a potential interest in participating will be offered a face to face interview with one of the study doctors to assess eligibility, answer questions, obtain details of all physicians involved in their care and obtain written consent prior to enrolment. We anticipate recruitment will be complete within 12 months of starting the study.","Inclusion Criteria:||Sporadic LAM diagnosed either by cystic lung disease on HRCT classical of LAM plus angiomyolipoma or chylous effusion or cystic lung disease on HRCT and tissue biopsy showing LAM or angiomyolipoma|TSC-LAM diagnosed by cystic lung disease on HRCT and tuberous sclerosis diagnosed by TSC consensus criteria(13).|Patients with either an FEV1 below 80% predicted or evidence of a 20% deterioration in FEV1.||Hormone and bronchodilator treatment for LAM* is allowed providing treatment has not changed in the three months prior to enrollment.||progesterone, GnRh agonists and bronchodilators||Exclusion Criteria:||Inability to give informed consent.|Mental retardation.|Age less than 18 years.|Pneumothorax, chylous effusion, bleeding angiomyolipoma or change in hormone treatment within 3 months.|Previous organ transplantation.|Severe or uncontrolled epilepsy.|Use of any oral contraceptive pill.|Pregnancy or breast feeding.

They are also occasionally used for ADHD when more conventional treatments, such as psychostimulants and tricyclic antidepressants, have failed (Botteron & Geller, 1998). Despite a helpful role for the antipsychotic medications in many childhood conditions, there is a persistent although poorly substantiated impression that these medicines cause ""cognitive blunting"" in children. This may be more commonly heard than seen in print, but we believe that it is the cause of considerable resistance to antipsychotic treatment by physicians and nonmedical professionals alike.||At the same time, the data supporting the notion of cognitive blunting by antipsychotic medicines is largely negative (although limited in amount) and frequently badly out of date (see Ernst, Malone, Rowan, George, Gonzales, & Silva, 1998; Aman, 1984; Aman, Marks, Turbott, Wilsher, & Merry, 1991). There are good theoretical reasons to believe that novel antipsychotics may have no effects on cognition or may actually enhance cognitive functioning, at least in some disorders (Borison, 1996; Meltzer, 1995; Stip, 1996). At least one study thus far has shown significantly improved cognitive performance in schizophrenic patients taking risperidone as compared with such patients taking high-potency classical antipsychotics or no treatment (Gallhofer, Bauer, Lis, Krieger, & Gruppe, 1996).||Another source of resistance to the use of antipsychotic medicines with young people is the possibility that they may cause tardive dyskinesia. However, available data on the novel antipsychotics suggests that they are substantially safer than classical antipsychotics in this respect. Nevertheless, data are limited because of the newness of agents like risperidone.||Our laboratory at O.S.U. is unique because it has a sophisticated computer-controlled cognitive-motor test battery. O.S.U. is one of seven universities supported by NIMH as part of its network of Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology (""RUPPs""). Recently, Dr. Mike Aman reviewed the available cognitive test systems on behalf of the Autism RUPP Group. From this exercise, it became quite clear to us that we maintain what is probably the world's best system for assessing the cognitive-motor effects of psychotropic drugs in children, especially children with developmental handicaps.||The experimental (research) portion of the treatment is to assess the effects of risperidone (Risperdal) on learning performance and motor movements in children. This study is looking at whether or not risperidone improves performance on certain cognitive-motor tasks. It is also looking to detect any negative side effects that the medicine has on children's body movements. Risperidone is often used to treat children with disruptive behaviors. This study will involve 18-20 children who are being treated by their own physicians with risperidone (for duration of 4 months or longer) for such behavior problems.","Inclusion Criteria:||Aged 4 to 14 years, inclusive|Male or female gender|Reason for receiving risperidone must include severe conduct problems|Received risperidone treatment for at least 4 months|Dosage in the range of 0.01 to 0.099 mg/kg/day|Capable of discontinuing risperidone for up to 14 days in the judgement of child's physician|Taking co-therapy with psychostimulants, antihistamines, melatonin, and chloral hydrate is allowed as long as co-therapy is held constant|Taking co-therapy for sleep with guanfacine hydrochloride, clonidine hydrochloride, and trazodone hydrochloride is allowed so long as co-therapy is held constant|Must have a reliable adult carer who can report on subject's behavior and attend scheduled assessments|Parent or guardian must give informed consent, and subject must give assent if 14 years of age or older|Must be considered physically healthy on the basis of physical exam and medical history.||Exclusion Criteria:||Patients who meet DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, dissociative disorder, major depression, schizoaffective disorder, substance induced psychotic disorder|Subjects who are pregnant|Subjects with known seizure disorder|Subjects with a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome|Subjects with a known or suspected history of severe drug allergy or hypersensitivity|Subjects must have no significant medical disease|Subjects must not be taking any other psychotropic medications.",30.0,,All,No,,,,Risperdal,Drug,"June 23, 2016",Estimate,"June 21, 2016",OTHER,Ohio State University,Columbus,United States,Ohio State University Nisonger Center,1748,Ohio,14 Years,4 Years,Effects of Risperidone on Cognitive-Motor Performance and Motor Movements in Chronically Medicated Children,Ohio State University,The Ohio State University Nisonger Center,Completed,,Phase 3,,,,Short Term Recognition Memory task (accuracy)|Titrated Delayed Matching-to-Sample task (accuracy)|Continuous Performance task (omission errors)|Seat Activity|Graduated Holes task (errors and error times),,,Principal Investigator,,1748,,,,,,,May 1999,,June 2016,Child,"November 15, 2006",Estimate,"November 13, 2006","November 13, 2006",Interventional,"April 13, 2022",,No

There is mounting evidence that ""conventional"" therapies aimed at traditional risk factors have not optimized clinical outcomes. For example, in the Heart Protection Study with 20,536 subjects, the 5-year risk of a first major vascular event (nonfatal MI or CHD death, stroke, or coronary or noncoronary revascularization) among placebo-treated patients was 25%. Treatment with simvastatin reduced this risk to 20% over 5 years, which would project out to a 10-year risk of 40%. (The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III considers ""high risk"" or CHD equivalent a 10-year risk of an event greater than 20%.) Even among patients entering the study with baseline low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) already near or at goal (i.e., LDL-C less than 116 mg/dL) and who achieved a mean on-trial LDL-C of 70 mg/dL with simvastatin, the 5-year risk of an event was still 18% (projecting to a 10-year risk of 36%). This residual and unacceptably high risk is likely due to the increasing prevalence of obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, and the metabolic syndrome. These disorders are typically accompanied by a constellation of abnormalities that include impaired glycemic control, hypertension, procoagulant and inflammatory states, and atherogenic dyslipidemia. The latter includes a wide spectrum of lipid abnormalities (low HDL-C, high triglycerides and triglyceride-rich remnant lipoproteins, and a preponderance of small dense, highly-oxidizable LDL particles).||Conventional LDL-C-focused therapies are not effective in targeting this type of dyslipidemia. Evidence that therapy directed at atherogenic dyslipidemia among patients with CHD can lower outcomes was shown with gemfibrozil in the VA-HIT trial, which showed a 22 to 24% cardiovascular (CV) event reduction by raising HDL-C (by an average of 6%) and lowering triglycerides (by an average of 31%). Niacin is an even more effective agent for simultaneously raising HDL-C and lowering triglycerides and levels of small dense LDL, and holds the most promise among existing therapies for substantial risk reduction in this population when added to a statin. This was demonstrated in the HDL Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (HATS) trial in which atherosclerosis progression was virtually halted and CV events were reduced by 60 to 90% using combined niacin plus statin therapy.||DESIGN NARRATIVE:||AIM-HIGH is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled clinical trial designed to test whether the drug combination of extended release niacin plus simvastatin is superior to simvastatin alone, at comparable levels of on-treatment LDL-C, for delaying the time to a first major CV disease outcome over a 4-year median follow-up in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia. Prior clinical trials have found only 25 to 35% CV risk reduction using statin monotherapy (i.e., event rate 2/3 to 3/4 of placebo rate). The study is needed to confirm whether statin-niacin combination therapy, designed to target a wider spectrum of dyslipidemic factors in addition to LDL-C, will provide a more substantial (greater than 50%) reduction of CV events. Epidemiologic studies confirm the high prevalence of atherogenic dyslipidemia and its impact on CV event rates. Preliminary clinical trials suggest that targeting these factors with dyslipidemic therapy will reduce CV events. The study will enroll an estimated 3,300 men and women more than 45 years old at high risk of recurrent CV events by virtue of having established CV disease together with the two dyslipidemic elements of metabolic syndrome: low HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) (less than or equal to 40 mg/dl) and high triglycerides (TG) (greater than or equal to 150 mg/dl). The study specifically aims to test this hypothesis for the primary composite clinical end point of CHD death, nonfatal MI, ischemic stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome with objective evidence of ischemia (troponin-positive or ST-segment deviation), or symptom-driven coronary or cerebral revascularization. Secondary end points include the composite of CHD death, nonfatal MI, ischemic stroke, or hospitalization for high-risk acute coronary syndrome; the composite of CHD death, nonfatal MI or ischemic stroke; and cardiovascular mortality.","Inclusion Criteria:||Men and women aged 45 and older with established vascular disease and atherogenic dyslipidemia|Established vascular disease defined as one or more of the following: (1) documented coronary artery disease (CAD); (2) documented cerebrovascular or carotid disease; (3) documented symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD)|Atherogenic dyslipidemia defined as: (1) LDL-C of less than or equal to 160 mg/dL (4.1 mmol/L); (2) HDL-C of less than or equal to 40 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L) for men or less than or equal to 50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) for women; (3) TG greater than or equal to 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) and less than or equal to 400 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L)|For patients entering the trial on a statin: (1) the upper limit for LDL-C is adjusted according to the specific statin and statin dose; (2) HDL-C of less than or equal to 42 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L) for men or less than or equal to 53 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) for women; (3) TG greater than or equal to 125 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) and less than or equal to 400 mg/DL (4.5 mmol/L)||Exclusion Criteria:||Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery within 1 year of planned enrollment (run-in phase)|Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within 4 weeks of planned enrollment (run-in phase)|Hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome and discharge within 4 weeks of planned enrollment (run-in phase)|Fasting glucose greater than 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) or hemoglobin A1C greater than 9%|For patients with diabetes, inability or refusal to use a glucometer for home monitoring of blood glucose|Concomitant use of drugs with a high probability of increasing the risk for hepatotoxicity or myopathy, such as those predominantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 system 3A4, including but not limited to cyclosporine, gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, itraconazole, ketoconazole, HIV protease inhibitors, nefazodone, verapamil, amiodarone; lipid-lowering drugs (other than the investigational drugs) such as statins, bile-acid sequestrants, cholesterol absorption inhibitors (e.g., ezetimibe), fibrates or high-dose, antioxidant vitamins (vitamins C, E, or beta carotene) that can interfere with the HDL-raising effect of niacin",3414.0,Actual,All,No,,Combination Therapy|Combination Therapy|Monotherapy,"2,000 mg/day or 1,500 mg/day if higher dose not tolerated|Dose adjusted to achieve LDL-C 40 mg/dL - 80 mg/dL, adding ezetimibe (10 mg/day) if needed to achieve LDL-C target",Extended release niacin|Simvastatin,Drug|Drug,"April 6, 2016",Estimate,"March 8, 2016",INDUSTRY,Axio Research.
