However, basic research suggests that some forms of ASD may be alleviated, even in the adult stage. The genes involved in ASDs particularly impact synaptic homeostasis. Specific clinical trials in patients with synaptic mutations need to be carried out. In this spirit, patients with deleterious mutations in SHANK3 represent a paradigm. The induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSc) carrying SHANK3 mutations and derived in neurons, can be used for high-throughput screening of pharmacological substances and allow the identification of compounds that can restore the expression level of SHANK3. The objective of this proposed project is to test one of the compounds identified by research on these iPSc as a novel treatment for social communication deficit in patients with deleterious mutations in SHANK3.

Oxytocin (OT) is a neurohormone involved in both repetitive/rigid and social behaviors. This study is focusing on how a single dose of intranasal OT (IN-OT) affects cognitive rigidity and social perception tasks. Taking OT as a spray through the nose increases social and decreases repetitive behavior in some adults with ASD, and we are exploring if it helps children with ASD similarly. However, it is unclear whether every person with ASD has an abnormal OT level, and if OT affects restrictive or social behavior differently. Consequently, we aim to study whether OT treatment can be effective in treating subgroups with specific features of ASD. We will use approaches utilizing both behavioral and physiological responses to clarify the role of OT in ASD. We will develop a deeper understanding of the range of social and rigid behaviors and use that information to identify persons with ASD who would benefit from OT treatment. Potential subjects will be asked if they want to participate in two sessions in our clinical laboratory where they will get either single dose IN-OT or placebo. After receiving the substance, they will be asked to do a handful of tasks while we monitor heart rate, eye movements, and collect baseline and post intranasal blood, urine and saliva. The levels of hormones, metabolites and peptides related to or interacting with OT will be measures in the collected samples of blood plasma, urine and saliva.
