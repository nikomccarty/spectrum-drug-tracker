NETT is a cognitive-behavioral intervention (CBI) for nonverbal communication, emotion recognition, and theory of mind deficits in youth with ASD.

The pathogenesis of TSC stems from TSC1 or TSC2 mutations, leading to the defect in mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition. Rapamycin is an mTOR inhibitor and is effective for TSC facial angiofibroma through topical administration. Calcitriol, a vitamin D3 analogue, has been shown to lessen skin fibrosis in scleroderma and may be therapeutically beneficial to angiofibromas.||Objectives: The aim of the study is to determine the effect and safety of topical rapamycin or calcitriol and their combination for the treatment of TSC-associated facial angiofibroma.||Methods: A total of 52 TSC patients including 20 male and 32 female subjects were recruited, and 50 of them completed the period 1 study.
