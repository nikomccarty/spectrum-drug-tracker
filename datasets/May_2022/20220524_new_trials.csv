The ability to complete the NIH-TBC oral reading and picture vocabulary subtest at baseline is defined as the ability to complete both subtests, with (1) confirmation from the clinician administering that the test administrations are valid (noted on the administration form) and (2) generation of valid test scores for each test.||History of or current cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, psychiatric, neurologic, cerebrovascular, or other systemic disease that would place the subject at risk or potentially interfere with the interpretation of the safety, tolerability, or efficacy of the study treatment.||a.
