ABI is a 62-item questionnaire completed on a web/mobile application or on paper. It is part of the Janssen Autism Knowledge Engine (JAKE), a research tool that tracks outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Each ABI item is answered on 1 of 2 possible dimensions, quality (how well a person carries out a particular behavior) or frequency (how often a particular behavior occurs). Each item is rated on a scale of 0-3 (never to very often [frequency] or not at all to without help [quality]). The ABI Core Domain Score is calculated as the sum of the scores in the Social Communication Domain and the Repetitive/Restrictive Behavior Domain divided by the total number of items in these 2 domains.|Change from baseline in the ABI social communication domain score will be reported.

ABI-S is the shorter version of the ABI. It consists of 24 items across 5 areas, social communication, RRB, mood and anxiety, challenging behavior, and self-regulation.

Responses range from 1 to 7, where 1 = None and 7 = Severe.|The Caregiver Assessment of Treatment is a 3-item questionnaire. Caregivers rate their global impression of improvement in their child's autism, whether there was improvement in specific symptoms, and their interest in having their child continue the study medication.
