ABI is a 62-item questionnaire completed on a web/mobile application or on paper. It is part of the Janssen Autism Knowledge Engine (JAKE), a research tool that tracks outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Each ABI item is answered on 1 of 2 possible dimensions, quality (how well a person carries out a particular behavior) or frequency (how often a particular behavior occurs). Each item is rated on a scale of 0-3 (never to very often [frequency] or not at all to without help [quality]). The ABI Core Domain Score is calculated as the sum of the scores in the Social Communication Domain and the Repetitive/Restrictive Behavior Domain divided by the total number of items in these 2 domains.|Change from baseline in the ABI social communication domain score will be reported.

ASD affects approximately 1% of the general population (Elsabbagh et al., 2012). Studies of siblings of individuals with ASD show that ASD is present in 7-20% of the offspring in families where a child has had a diagnosis of ASD and this prevalence increases if there are two diagnosed children.||Several studies show the benefits of interventions targeting parents' interaction strategies in the early phases of development of infants at high risk for ASDs, in reducing the risk itself or its severity. Very early intervention, due to the presence of significant brain plasticity at these stages, may be particularly effective in changing these emerging trajectories, from a ""preventive intervention"" perspective that would aim to mitigate developmental risk and alter prodromal symptom trajectories, rather than eliminate a condition.||Our hypothesis is that the implementation of a specific therapeutic education program during a new pregnancy in the mother of a child with a diagnosis of ASD (MER Program) could improve the mother's well-being, increase parenting communication skills, and thereby improve interaction with the newborn at high risk for ASD.

In addition, clinical observations and preliminary data suggest increased overall body fat in these individuals, as well as a relative increase in fat deposition in the lower extremities.

What is yet unknown is precisely how imitation in children with ASD differs from that of typically developing peers.The investigators have identified a task parameter that separates preserved from impaired gesture imitation in ASD: children with ASD have difficulty imitating when the task requires two separate movement elements be coordinated simultaneously. By contrast, imitation is relatively preserved when movement elements are performed serially. The coordination of simultaneous movements is a hallmark of actions performed in the real world. With an eye to optimizing common therapies that depend heavily on imitation, the next step is to tease apart where, in the chain from perception to action, the capacity limitation in simultaneous processing lies. This study will be conducted in about two days and will involve imitating gestures that are presented via video. In addition, an EEG will record the brain's electrical activity during certain tasks to assess how the brain responds when the imitation task is more or less difficult.

The Kaplan-Meier estimate was used for determining time to SEGA response.|Duration of SEGA response was defined as time from the date of the first documented SEGA response until the date of the first documented SEGA progression. Duration of SEGA response was evaluated only for participants who achieved a SEGA response. The time to SEGA progression was censored if SEGA progression was not observed before the first to occur out of (i) analysis cut-off date (ii) the date when systemic anti-SEGA medication is started, (iii) the date of a SEGA-related surgery or (iv) the date of death. Since, no case of SEGA progression was observed in core study which resulted in censored duration of SEGA response. Only 5 SEGA responders experienced a SEGA progression in extension period.|Time to SEGA worsening was defined as the time from the start of everolimus to date of the first SEGA worsening. SEGA worsening was defined as either; increase from nadir of ≥ 25% in SEGA volume or unequivocal worsening of non-target SEGA lesions, or appearance of new SEGA lesion ≥ 1.0 cm in longest diameter, or new or worsening hydrocephalus. The median value was not reached in either treatment arm of core period as SEGA worsening was observed in less participants (everolimus - 7 and placebo - 8).|Skin lesions included hypomelanotic macules, the shagreen patch, periungual or subungual fibromas, facial angiofibromas and/or forehead plaques. Response was evaluated using the Physician's Global Assessment of Clinical Condition (PGA) on a 7-point scale: Grade 0 = complete clinical response, indicated absence of disease, Grade 1, 2, and 3 = partial response, indicated improvements of ≥ 50% but < 100%, Grade 4, 5 = stable disease, indicated some or no improvements of 25% - < 50% and 6 = progressive disease, indicated worse than at baseline evaluation by > 25%. Response rate was determined for participants with ≥ 1 skin lesion at baseline, defined as the percentage of participants with overall status as complete clinical response or partial response.|Duration of skin lesion response was defined as the time from the first skin lesion response until the first skin lesion progression, defined as worsening of lesion by > 25% or more from baseline.|The participants were assessed for everolimus blood concentration at 2 hours time point after dose administration on the same day, if the participant did not vomit between previous dose and blood sample collection. Tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method was used for evaluation. C2h values were categorized as < 20 ng/mL, 20-50 ng/mL, and > 50 ng/mL, concentrations below the lower limit of quantification were entered as 0 ng/mL.|The participants were assessed for everolimus trough concentration (Cmin) at 24 hours time point after previous dose administration, at a steady state following 5 days of consistent dosing, if the participant did not vomit within 4 hours of previous dose. Tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method was used for evaluation. Cmin values were categorized as <5 ng/mL, 5-10 ng/mL, and >10 ng/mL, concentrations below the lower limit of quantification were entered as 0 ng/mL.|Renal function was assessed using glomerular filtration rate (GFR) based on age measure; Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula for participants aged 18 years or older, defined as GFR equal to 32788*(serum creatinine (micromol/L)^-1.154)*(age^-0.203 )*(0.742, if female)*(1.210, if black), and Schwartz formula for participants less than 18 years defined as GFR equal to 0.41*height (cm)/ Serum creatinine (mg/dL). Participants with severe renal impairment defined as GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 and participants with National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) grade 3/4 serum creatinine were reported.",Change From Baseline in Frequency of Total Seizure Events Per 24 Hours at Week 24 in Both Core and Extension Period|Time to SEGA Progression|Time to SEGA Response|Duration of SEGA Response|Time to SEGA Worsening|Percentage of Participants With Skin Lesions Assessed Using Physician's Global Assessement Overall Score|Duration of Skin Lesion Response in Everolimus Treated Participants|Everolimus Blood Concentration (C2h) at 2 Hours Post Dose|Everolimus Trough Concentrations (Cmin) at 24 Hours After Last Dose|Percentage of Participants With Renal Impairment During Core Period,"Baseline (Core period) to Week 24 (Core period), Baseline (Extension period, Week 24 post-core baseline) to Week 24 (Extension period, Week 48 post-core baseline)|Baseline up to week 48 (end of core period), and end of extension period (up to 4 years)|Baseline up to week 48 (end of core period), and end of extension period (up to 4 years)|Baseline up to week 48 (end of core period), and end of extension period (up to 4 years)|Baseline up to week 48 (end of core period), and end of extension period (up to 4 years)|End of core period (Week 48), and end of extension period (up to 4 years)|Baseline up to week 48 (end of core period), and end of extension period (up to 4 years)|2 hours post dose on Week 6, Week 24, Week 48, Week 96, Week 144, and Week 240|24 hours post dose on Week 6, Week 24, Week 48, Week 72, Week 96, Week 144, and Week 240|Day 1 up to 28 days after end of treatment (Core period)",Aug-09,,Jan-16,Child|Adult|Older Adult,13-Nov-08,Estimate,12-Nov-08,12-Nov-08,Interventional,16-Dec-21,,Yes
