However, basic research suggests that some forms of ASD may be alleviated, even in the adult stage. The genes involved in ASDs particularly impact synaptic homeostasis. Specific clinical trials in patients with synaptic mutations need to be carried out. In this spirit, patients with deleterious mutations in SHANK3 represent a paradigm. The induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSc) carrying SHANK3 mutations and derived in neurons, can be used for high-throughput screening of pharmacological substances and allow the identification of compounds that can restore the expression level of SHANK3. The objective of this proposed project is to test one of the compounds identified by research on these iPSc as a novel treatment for social communication deficit in patients with deleterious mutations in SHANK3.

Such perceptual optimization reflects the shifting excitatory and inhibitory actions of individual neurons. We hypothesize that the brain's processing of vibration is similar to its processing of other kinds of information. We also hypothesize that in people with ASD adjacent groups of neurons work together less well to process information.||Specific Aim 1: Obtain evidence regarding the ability of the ""cortical metric"" to distinguish between 8-12 year-olds with typical development and with high functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).||Hypothesis 1: The cortical metric of children with ASD will differ from that of age matched, typically developing children. This difference will be consistent with lower than normal local functional connectivity.||Specific Aim 2: Validate the test-retest reliability of the cortical metric by examining its stability of over an average of 3 weeks with no intervening interventions in both groups of children.||Hypothesis 2: Test-retest reliability will be highly correlated in both groups of children.||Specific Aim 3: Obtain preliminary proof of mechanism data that the cortical metric assesses the excitatory: inhibitory balance of intra-cortical connections by examining the effect of acute exposure to dextromethorphan (DXM), which transiently blocks one type of excitatory neurotransmission||Hypothesis 3: DXM will alter the cortical metric consistent with reduced adaptation.||The completion of these aims will be essential to design a larger federally funded trial to validate the cortical metric as an outcome measure in a more heterogeneous pediatric ASD sample.

Caregivers mark on a visual line measuring 10 cm with ""worst behavior"" at 0 cm and ""best behavior"" at 10 cm. For each behavior the caregiver is instructed to mark their impression of the behavior at baseline visit and again at the six-month visit. The calculated distance in cm between the marks drawn at the baseline and six-month visits thereby demonstrates whether each behavior improved, worsened, or stayed the same during the study, and by how much. Shown here is the mean distance in cm from the ""worst behavior"" side for the Language/Communication scale, at baseline. The smaller the value, the worse the behavior.

ASD affects as many as 1 in 90-150 children. Sleep issues/insomnia is very common in children with ASD (50-80%). Insomnia has a negative impact on both the developmental and behavioral function of the child and the quality of life for the family. Causes of insomnia in children with ASD are multifactorial and can be difficult to treat effectively. Low iron stores, as manifest by low serum ferritin levels, is also common in children with ASD. Both insomnia and low iron stores are associated with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and Periodic Limb Movement of Sleep (PLMS). Children with ASD often have difficulty communicating symptoms or tolerating Polysomnography (Sleep Study). This makes establishing a diagnosis of RLS or PLMS very difficult in children with ASD. Because polysomnography is not well tolerated in children with ASD and cannot measure sleep over time in a natural environment, improvements in sleep with treatment with iron will be measured by standard actigraphy (a watch that measures movements during sleep) and sleep diaries. The investigators also propose to evaluate periodic limb movement index (PLMI) as a predictor of response to iron treatment for insomnia in children with ASD, as measured by the PAM-RL, an actigraph designed to measure PLMS. The investigators will collect secondary data regarding attention and behavior over the course of the study to monitor improvement in daytime functioning in both groups. Many clinicians will empirically treat children with ASD, insomnia and low ferritin levels (< 50ng/ml) with iron. This is based on data from a previous open label trial demonstrating subjective improvement in restless sleep in children with ASD with low/low normal ferritin levels who were treated with iron. In order to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment, The investigators propose a randomized placebo-controlled trial of oral elemental iron for treatment of insomnia in children with ASD and ferritin levels that are low but above the laboratory cut off for deficiency. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of treatment of insomnia with oral ferrous sulfate (iron) at a dose of 3mg/kg divided twice per day for 3 months compared to placebo.","Inclusion Criteria:||Child has a clinical diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) criteria, confirmed by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule.|Age 2 years to 10 years 11 months.|Child has sleep onset latency of greater than 40 minutes on 3 or more nights per week, an average greater than 30 minutes per night, or night waking at least 3 times per week requiring parental intervention or lasting >20 minutes per night.|A mean sleep latency of 30 minutes or more, or night waking will be need to be confirmed by 7 days of scorable actigraphy data prior to randomization.|Ferritin between 17ng/ml and 49 ng/ml, confirmed at a central lab.|The child has been screened for medical conditions that affect sleep by their clinician and referred for subspecialty evaluation, as needed, for coexisting disorders (e.g., Gastrointestinal reflux disease, epilepsy).|We will include children with coexisting medical, psychiatric, and neurological disorders as long as they have been evaluated by a physician and a treatment plan has been implemented, with the child on a stable dose of medication for one month|Parents and their child are willing and able to provide informed consent (and assent, depending on child's age and cognitive function) and to cooperate with study procedures.

Clinical measures of social cognition described below will be obtained to address Aim 3 (to assess for clinically measurable improvements in social cognition deficits).||Clinical Assessments The subjects will be assessed with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) to confirm the diagnosis of ASD. The Ohio Autism Clinical Impressions Scale will assess overall severity of autism-specific symptoms. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID 7.0.2) will be used to document comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. The Weschler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence (WASI-2) will be used to assess IQ. Social cognition deficits will be assessed using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test (RMET), the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2), and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II (VABS-II) Socialization subdomain. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist, Community version (ABC), will be used to quantify behavioral measures associated with ASD. To assess whether clinical improvements with gabapentin extend beyond effects on social cognition, other symptom domains will be assessed pre- and post-treatment as well. Specifically, information on repetitive and/or compulsive behaviors will be obtained using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (CY-BOCS-PDD). The ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD RS-IV) will be used to assess ADHD symptoms, the Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS) to assess depressive symptoms and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, 2nd edition, (MASC-2) will be used to assess anxiety-related symptoms.||In addition to traditional outcome measures for social functioning in ASD, including parent report measures (SRS-2) and theory of mind tasks (RMET), a novel technique of measuring social motor coordination will be used that was developed as a potential outcome measure in ASD clinical trials. This assessment involves a video-based analysis of whole-body social motor coordination during a more naturalistic task, the conversation task of an ADOS-2 administration. Changes in social motor coordination will be evaluated in relation to changes in GABA levels with treatment over the course of the clinical trial.||Baseline MRI T1- and T2-weighted high-resolution structural imaging (T1- and T2-weighted (MPRAGE)) will be acquired, along with a baseline MRS using MEsher-Garwood Point REsolved Spectroscopy Sequence (MEGA-PRESS: TE: 68 ms, TR: 2 s) to quantify GABA in a 4 cm x 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm voxel localized in the RAI. Imaging sessions will be conducted at the Advanced MRI Center (AMRIC) at UMMS, which houses a 3.0 Tesla Philips Achieva MRI research scanner (Philips Healthcare, Best, Netherlands) and 8 element phase-array receiver SENSE head coil.||The baseline MRI protocol also leverages collaborations with the Human Connectome (HCP) and Adolescent Brain Cognitive Developments (ABCD) projects and is designed to support integration with national multi-site studies for added protocol utility. The scan session will include 1) a 3D T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo scan for cortical and subcortical segmentation (6.5 min); 2) a 3D T2-weighted variable flip angle fast spin echo scan for screening out white matter lesions and quantification of CSF (6 min); 3) a diffusion imaging scan, for segmentation of white matter tracts and measurement of diffusion parameters (1.5mm isotropic, b=1000; 110 directions acquired with both AP and PA phase encoding; 2 x 5 min); 4) a resting state fMRI scan (2mm isotropic ; TR 750 ms; AP, PA phase encoding; (2-5.75 min runs).||Acute Response of GABA levels A second MRS scan will be obtained two hours after an approximately 20 mg/kg challenge with gabapentin to obtain the acute response for Aim 2. Subjects will receive a single dose of gabapentin. The dose used will be calculated to provide the highest possible dose to the nearest 100 mg without exceeding 1500 mg or 20 mg/kg, whichever is lower. The weight exclusion criteria ensures that all subjects will receive at least 17 mg/kg dose. All subjects will be monitored for adverse effects for up to 4 hours following administration of the single dose and will have direct phone access to the principal investigator (24 hours/ 7 days a week) for reporting of any post-observation adverse effects. A blood sample to assess drug level will be taken as close to 3 hours after administration as possible, allowing time for imaging scan and transport to clinical trials unit for blood draw. This will be used to control for variability in bioavailability in interpreting the cortical GABA level changes.|Clinical Trial of Gabapentin The study involves an 8-week open-label clinical trial with gabapentin in 40 adolescents age 13-17 years who meet DSM-5 criteria for ASD. At the acute gabapentin dosing visit, baseline safety labs will be obtained, including complete blood count; comprehensive metabolic panel including electrolytes, renal function tests, and liver function tests; and creatine kinase. Baseline EKG will be obtained as well. The above labs will be repeated at week 4 and week 8 of the clinical trial, or if adverse events occur which indicate the need for testing.||At baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, and 8, the following clinical measures will be obtained: OACIS-S, OACIS-I (for post-baseline visits). At baseline and at 8 weeks, the following assessments will also be administered: VABS-II, SRS-2 (modified to ask about symptoms in previous 2 weeks), RMET, ABC, CY-BOCS-PDD, ADHD-RS-IV, MASC-2, and CDRS-R. ADOS-2 will also be re-administered at week 8 for videotape assessment of social motor coordination as described above. At week 8, a trough serum gabapentin level will be obtained to account for variability in bioavailability as a potential confounding factor. At week 8, the MRS scan will be repeated to evaluate RAI GABA levels, and also include a resting state functional MRI scan.","Inclusion Criteria:||Age 13-17 years|English as primary language (both child and legal guardian)|DSM-5 criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder|IQ >70 per Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI)|Informed assent for the study (The guardian must also give written informed consent)|For sexually active females, agreement to use two forms of contraception during trial to avoid pregnancy||Exclusion Criteria:||Any neurological disorder (e.g., cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome, cerebral neoplasm, bacterial meningitis, epilepsy, etc.)|Genetic disorders (e.g., Fragile X, Rett Syndrome, etc.)|Contraindications for MRI, such as metallic or electronic implants in the body, or severe claustrophobia|Unstable psychiatric disorder expected to require psychotropic medication changes over the course of the study|History of psychotic disorder|Any condition that would prevent the subject from being able to complete study protocol|Unstable medical illness such as diabetes, asthma, thyroid disease|Currently on medications that cause respiratory depression, e.g. opioids, benzodiazepines|Clinically significant suicidal ideation as assessed by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale|History of intolerance to gabapentin or pregabalin|Current substance use (including nicotine)|Current treatment with gabapentin|History of renal dysfunction|Subjects who weigh more than 88 kg|Pregnancy in female participants.",40.0,Anticipated,All,No,Yes,Gabapentin Open-label treatment,"8 weeks of gabapentin, titrated up to 20 mg/kg in 3 divided doses daily",Gabapentin,Drug,"October 8, 2021",Actual,"September 30, 2021",OTHER,David Cochran,Worcester,United States,University of Massachusetts Medical School,208,Massachusetts,17 Years,13 Years,Biomarker-Driven Pharmacological Treatment for Autism Spectrum Disorder,"University of Massachusetts, Worcester",UMass Medical School,Not yet recruiting,No,Phase 4,November 2023,Anticipated,Cortical GABA Levels in right anterior insula as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy,Right Anterior Insula GABA level,8 weeks,,Sponsor-Investigator,,208,Actual,"August 22, 2018","April 19, 2021",,,,"November 14, 2017",Actual,May 2021,Child|Adult,"June 22, 2017",Actual,"June 20, 2017","June 20, 2017",Interventional,"December 16, 2021",PI left institution.

Despite the dramatic rise in the detected prevalence of ASD over the past two decades, no effective medical treatment has been developed to address core ASD symptoms (social communication and repetitive behavior), the closely associated problem of language impairment, or the underlying pathophysiology of ASD. Currently, the only accepted treatment for core ASD symptoms is behavior therapy, which may entail intensive one-on-one treatment over several years.||The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of folinic acid in the treatment of language problems in children with autism spectrum disorder.

The Passport was adapted through a partnership between St. Michael's hospital and Autism Films Inc. into a mobile application called My Autism Passport (MAP). MAP allows families to learn about, and manage publicly-funded ASD services from their mobile device. Users can locate resources within their region, and track their progress in accessing services across multiple service agencies. The user can also set reminders on MAP which will be synced with their calendars, record notes, and read short summaries of the services offered by regional agencies. In this way, the application keeps families engaged, and allows them to take control of their child's care.||The feasibility of the MAP mobile application will be assessed by clinicians and end users. Clinicians from five developmental diagnostic organizations that have more than one year of experience diagnosing and providing follow up care to children with ASD will be informed of the study and invited to participate in recruitment in their respective practices. Caregivers of a child that is given a new diagnosis of ASD will be invited to participate in the study and be randomized to the control group or non control group and may have access to the application for 18 months. During the 18 month period, data on how caregivers are using the app will be collected. At 6, 12 and 18 months, caregivers will be invited to participate in questionnaires on number of services accessed, parent stress levels and self-efficacy levels. Questionnaires and interviews will be quantitatively analyzed for differences between groups, and findings will be used to improve the app prior to a larger prospective clinical trial.",Exploring the Efficacy and Usability of the My Autism Passport (MAP).,elizabeth.young@unityhealth.to,"Elizabeth Young, MD","February 1, 2022",Anticipated,Autism Spectrum Disorder,Autism|Autism Spectrum Disorder,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Double,Other,Investigator|Outcomes Assessor,294,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Subjects with a diagnosis of ASD as defined by DSM-5, confirmed by clinical evaluation and supported by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)|Ages 18- 35 years inclusive|IQ estimate of >80|Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC)-Social Withdrawal Score >10 (>40% over population mean for developmentally disabled adults)|Existing allowed concomitant medication treatment stable for the 8 weeks prior to study entry, and no anticipated changes|Ability to comply with all protocol procedures and assessments|Availability of a reliable parent or caregiver willing to provide information regarding subject behavior and health status|Evidence of EEG biomarker deficit as defined below.||Exclusion Criteria:||Evidence of current drug or alcohol abuse or dependence|Prior history of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence in prior 12 months|History of seizure disorder (except febrile seizures)|Clinically significant aggressive, disruptive, or suicidal behavior in the 3 months prior to study enrollment|Presence of a chronic medical condition or prohibited medication (see list in Human Subjects section) which would potentially interfere with the assessment of treatment effects, or interact with study medications (eg. hepatic, neurologic, renal disease) to increase risk to the subject|History of paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines|Clinically significant deviation from the reference range in clinical laboratory test results at screening, as judged by the investigator|ALT or AST greater than the upper limit of the laboratory standard reference range at screening|EKG abnormalities considered to be clinically significant as determined by the investigator and confirmed by an experienced cardiologist|Fredericia-corrected QT (QTcF) interval of >450 msec|Clinical judgment of the study physician of inability to perform the requirements of the study|For sexually active female and male subjects, refusal to agree to maintain a double-barrier birth control method during protocol participation",40.0,Actual,All,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,,Double-blind (active versus placebo)|Placebo,,AZD7325|Placebo,Drug|Drug,"October 22, 2015",Estimate,"October 21, 2015",OTHER,"University of California, Los Angeles",Los Angeles|Atlanta|Seattle,United States|United States|United States,UCLA|Emory University|Seattle Children's Research Institute,294,California|Georgia|Washington,35 Years,18 Years,Targeting GABA-A for the Treatment of Social Disability in Young Adults With Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Phase II Proof of Mechanism Trial,"University of California, Los Angeles","University of California, Los Angeles",Completed,Yes,Phase 2,July 2015,Actual,,EEG,week 6,,Principal Investigator,,294,,,,"Caregivers will complete the Parent Stress Scale.

Individuals with ASD often have behavioral issues and psychiatric comorbidities which can be very hard to manage. Currently, there are only two FDA approved medications (aripiprazole and risperidone) for the treatment of irritability in ASD. Both medications have the potential for side effects and are not tolerated in all children with ASD. Anecdotal and some preliminary studies suggest that cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid in the marijuana plant, may lead to improvements in symptoms of ASD including irritability, aggressive behaviors, and anxiety.||In this study the investigators will test whether CBD leads to differences in behaviors commonly associated with ASD. The main behavioral problems investigators will study are irritability and aggressive behavior. This study will also measure changes in other behaviors seen in ASD such as anxiety, social interaction difficulties, repetitive behaviors, attentional problems, hyperactivity, repetitive behaviors, and quality of life.

ASD is defined by impairments in social-communication as well as the presence of restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. ASD is frequently associated with co-occurring language delays. Currently the only well-accepted treatment for core ASD symptoms is behavior therapy such as Applied Behavioral Analysis and Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention. There is no US Food and Drug Administration approved medical therapy that addresses core ASD symptoms or the pathophysiological processes that underlie ASD.||The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a liquid form of leucovorin calcium on language impairments in very young children with ASD. Participants entered into the trial will have delayed social and communication abilities known to be associated with ASD. The investigators hypothesize that leucovorin calcium will significantly improve language as well as core and associated behavioral symptoms of ASD, and be well-tolerated with no significant adverse effects, in young children with ASD. The investigators further hypothesize that a combination of baseline cellular and genetic biomarkers will predict cognitive and behavioral response to the intervention.||To assess whether the liquid form of leucovorin calcium is superior to placebo, the investigators will study 80 children across two sites, between the ages of 2.5 and 5 years, with confirmed ASD and known language delays at baseline.

Clinically, patients are normal before six months to one and half years old, and then develop progressive severe problems with communication, learning, co-ordination and neurodevelopment, with loss of motor skills around the age of two. At the same time, stereotyped hand movement typically appears. However, some of them will improve the abilities in speech and eye gaze, and the repetitive hand movements may decrease after few years.||Background / hypothesis：Preliminary evidence suggests that there are many differences in brain structure between Rett syndrome and normal people including cerebral volume reduction in both white matter and gray matter, cerebral blood flow in the frontal area, and density of receptors in basal ganglia. In MR imaging studies, decreases in parietal lobe gray matter were found, and several reductions in cortical white matter were observed by DTI. However, the visual related pathway- posterior corona radiata in Rett syndrome girls was normal to be increased in FA values. The similar result was also discovered in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, associated with speech, which equal to control subjects and patients with preserved speech (phrases and sentences).Despite this, few studies mentioned comparison with brain microstructure in the different stage, especially in adult patients. Therefore, our prospective study will be planned to figure out the specific changing pattern of brain structure in different stages of Rett syndrome. And the trajectory of microstructure in brain is going to be in accordance with the functional improvement.||The investigators suppose that (1)there are different microstructural changes for patients with/without preserved mobility, verbal ability and communication skill; (2)there are a few specific brain microstructures changes in visual pathway; (3) there is a specific changing pattern of brain microstructure in different aging of Rett syndrome.

Cannabidivarin (CBDV) is a nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid and a safe variant of Cannabidiol (CBD). It has no appreciable tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) [less than 0.01%], has been shown to have no impact on weight or metabolism, and improves both social and cognitive functioning in animal models of idiopathic and syndromal autism (Fragile X, Rett Syndrome, Angelman Syndrome). The CDC currently estimates 1 in 59 children have ASD. ASD is characterized by deficits in social communication, irritability, repetitive behaviors, impulsivity, temper tantrums, and high caregiver burden. Currently, the only FDA-approved medications for symptoms of ASD are aripiprazole and risperidone, both of which are indicated for irritability in pediatric ASD. These medications are effective but are associated with considerable side effects with long term treatment in this chronic developmental disorder, including weight gain, metabolic syndrome and the risk of type 2 diabetes, prolactin elevation and growth of breast tissue, extrapyramidal symptoms and the risk of tardive dyskinesia. The anticonvulsant divalproex sodium (valproate/VPA) also significantly reduces irritability and repetitive behaviors in individuals with ASD. Although VPA is efficacious for pediatric epilepsy and some symptoms of ASD, it also has significant side effects, including weight gain, sedation and nausea. CBDV, like VPA, is effective in the treatment of pediatric epilepsy, and ASD mouse models demonstrate potential mechanisms for treatment with CBDV, including potential therapeutic effects on repetitive behaviors, irritability, sociability, and quality of life, and the capacity to reduce inflammation. This study aims to examine the efficacy and safety of cannabidivarin (CBDV) with a primary aim of studying its effect on irritability in children with ASD.||STUDY DESIGN: This is a 12-week randomized, double-blind study of CBDV vs. placebo in 100 child and adolescent subjects aged 5 to 18 years with a diagnosis of ASD.","Inclusion Criteria||Male or Female pediatric outpatients aged between and including ages 5 to 18.

We made the observation today that research findings clearly in the field of autism and schizophrenic disorders that converge on common patterns neurocognitive abnormalities. Consequently, many programs support published today use the same therapeutic targets and the same tools in both pathologies. This raises two questions of science: (1) whether the disorders of social cognition reported in the field of autism and schizophrenia are ""specific deficit"" and not ""specific condition"", that is to say they are inherent social disadvantage whatever condition or (2) if these disorders of social cognition is a pattern common to autism and schizophrenia but are the result of specific neurocognitive mechanisms and different in each these pathologies.

They may represent a measure of the excitatory-inhibitory imbalance posited to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Treatment of epilepsy is always indicated, but treatment of isolated epileptiform EEG (i.e. in the absence of clinical seizures) is frankly controversial. Since data suggest that these epileptiform discharges are associated with deficits in attention, language and behavior, the investigators believe that they may represent an important and novel treatment target in this population. The proposed study brings together a group of investigators long interested in this problem in order to investigate the efficacy of using an anticonvulsant medication with spike suppression capabilities (VPA in the form of divalproex sodium) to treat children with ASD and isolated epileptiform EEGs.

Parents of potential subjects will do a preliminary phone screen, followed by a clinical evaluation by a psychiatrist for possible inclusion in the study. Informed written consent and assent will be obtained from the parents and subjects respectively once deemed competent and before the initiation of any study procedures.||Clinical Evaluation will use the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) to establish a formal diagnosis.||Study Procedures Baseline Assessments: Many baseline measures for physical health will be done at the screening visit and during the first weekly visit. These will include a clinical interview, physical and neurological examination will be done during the screening period and height, weight and vital signs, and a calculation of his/her Body Mass Index (BMI) will be done during the screening period and during the first weekly visit. Laboratory measures at baseline and study completion will include a complete metabolic panel (with liver transaminases) and complete blood count with differential. Further measures will include a fasting lipid profile, hemoglobin A1C, prolactin level and insulin levels, and fasting blood sugar level (FBS). Serum albumin will be measured not only as a measure of nutritional state, but also in accordance with the fact that aripiprazole is 99% protein-bound. An electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed at the beginning and end of the study to monitor for possible cardiac effects. These measures are aimed at monitoring side effects reported in the use of other medications in this class. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed for each female subject at the beginning and end of the study.||Outcome measures will include the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale for children (BPRS-C), Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S), Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) and the Atypical Children's Development Scale (ACDS).||Baseline parameters for extrapyramidal side effects will be established using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), the Simpson Angus Extrapyramidal Side Effect Scale (SAEPS) and the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale. Baseline values for general side effects will be compiled using the Monitoring of Side Effects System (MOSES).||Weekly visits: At all visits, patients will undergo a clinical interview, vital signs, and weight measures. Custodial guardian(s) will provide collateral information. The weekly ""short"" visits will occur at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. They will be about 45 minutes in duration.||Ongoing outcome measures will be performed at visits 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11. The visits will be about 1-1.5 hours in duration. The measures done will include those at the short visits, as well as the Y-BOCS, BPRS, ABC and CGI-S. Side effects will be monitored using the AIMS, SAEPS, Barnes Akathisia Scale and MOSES at these visits.||Termination Visit: The last visit (Visit 13 or earlier if patient drops out of the study) will include the repetition of all measures at visit 1 (except the ADI-R) and will last about 2 hours. All baseline laboratory measures will be repeated at this time.||Follow-Up Patient Care: After completion of the clinical trial, the patients will be followed at the Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA) Center for Child and Adolescent Development until they can be referred back to their original psychiatric providers or to appropriate treatment providers in the community.||Medication dosing: Aripiprazole will be started at 2.5mg or 5mg depending on clinical impression and severity of especially aggression and agitation. At the weekly visits, the dose will be adjusted in not more than 5mg increments according to clinical impression. The lowest effective dose will be used, up to a maximum dose of 20mg.||Patients already taking psychotropic medications will be tapered off their medications during the first 1-2 weeks of the study. The dose will be reduced to 67% of the initial dose for 3 days and then to 33% of the initial dose for 3 days and then the medication(s) will be discontinued. The subjects will remain off of on enrollment medications for 5 half lives and then aripiprazole will be initiated. Anticonvulsant medications taken for seizure control may be continued throughout the trial as long as the subject has been on a stable dose for 30 days prior to the study and has been seizure free for 6 months. These medication doses will be held stable throughout the trial.||Adverse Events: Any serious adverse event leading to hospitalization will lead to study discontinuation. Any event requiring concomitant medication(s) will also lead to discontinuation. Adverse events will be reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) if there is an event requiring medical attention, or scores 3 or higher on the MOSES scale. Also, failure to comply with the study instructions will result in termination from the protocol.","Inclusion Criteria:||Males and Females ages 6-17|A diagnosis of Autism, Asperger's Disorder, or Pervasive Developmental Disorder - not otherwise specified (PDD NOS)|Medically healthy|Ability to give assent|Significant tantrums, aggression, self-injurious behavior and/or agitation by achieving a score of 18 or higher on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-irritability subscale and a score of moderate or higher on the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity Scale.||Exclusion Criteria:||Co-morbid serious mental illness.|Intelligence Quotient (IQ) <50, based on verified records of cognitive testing performed within 2 years of enrollment.

These symptoms are associated with increased social deficits, depression, irritability, and stereotyped and self-injurious behaviors. Children and adolescents with anxiety also frequently avoid potentially stressful situations, thereby missing opportunities to learn important new skills. Despite the significant consequences of anxiety symptoms, several critical treatment-relevant issues remain unresolved. First, there is a lack of clarity about how to differentiate ASD and anxiety symptoms. Second, little is known about how anxiety manifests in those with ASD and intellectual disability (ID). Third, the neural substrates of anxiety in ASD are poorly understood. The overarching goal of this project is to investigate these open issues in order to make interventions more precise, more personalized, and more likely to promote positive outcomes -- an objective consistent with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Roadmap, Precision Medicine, and Research Domain Criteria Project (RDoC) Initiatives and the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) Strategic Plan, Chapter 4.||While there is no doubt that anxiety is a very serious issue for those with ASD, what to do about this problem is less clear. The search for empirically-validated treatments has begun with multiple small trials providing promising evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) might reduce anxiety in those with ASD. However, this work is in its early stages. There is a great need for large, rigorously designed trials that validate the effectiveness of both medication and CBT, as well as functional neuroimaging studies that identify neural predictors of treatment efficacy and markers of therapy-induced change. Such work holds the potential to help answer the questions posed above and to assist the field in developing more personalized treatments. In Project 1 of the Center for the Development of Phenotype-Based Treatments of Autism Spectrum Disorder, we will conduct a study in children with ASD and clinically significant anxiety ages 8-14 to compare efficacy of these different treatment types.||The overall aims of the study are to better characterize the sub-group of children and preadolescents with ASD that exhibit clinically significant anxiety and fears through a 16-week randomized comparative treatment trial of Behavioral Intervention for Anxiety in Children with Autism (BIACA), sertraline, and placebo in youth with ASD, IQ>50, and clinically significant anxiety as assessed by a PARS score that is greater than or equal to 8. Clinician-administered gold standard assays will be used of traditional DSM (Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale [PARS] and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-IV [ADIS-IV]), and nontraditional ASD related anxiety symptoms (Autism Spectrum Addendum to the ADIS [ASDD]), as well as parent reports of potentially overlapping symptoms that complicate the ASD anxiety phenotype. Additionally fMRI will be used to investigate neural predictors of treatment efficacy, markers of treatment induced change, and signatures of anxiety sub-types.","Inclusion Criteria:||Outpatient boys and girls with ASD between ages 8-14 years at consent.|Meets criteria for a diagnosis of ASD.|Meets criteria for clinically significant anxiety symptoms as defined by a minimum score of 8 on the PARS Severity Scale.|Meets criteria for clinically significant anxiety symptoms as defined by qualifying for diagnosis on 1 or more non-phobia items on the ADIS.|The child has a Verbal Comprehension IQ greater than 50 as assessed on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence or other standardized cognitive measure.|Anxiety symptoms are considered the primary mental health problem (i.e., most impairing/distressing)|Stable medication regimen for 8 weeks prior to screening visit, including alternative medication, nutritionals, or therapeutic diets.||Stable non-psychotherapy regimen for 4 weeks prior to screening visits.

Maintenance of sleep is a significant challenge in the treatment of children with neurodevelopmental disabilities including ASDs. Night awakening or early morning waking can have detrimental effects on these children's daytime behavior and the functioning of their household. Sleep problems in the ASD population are generally managed first with behavioral interventions and, when these are not successful, pharmacologic therapy. Most medications effect sleep onset and not sleep maintenance. This study investigates the effectiveness of Melatonin CR for managing ISM in 4-8 year old children with ASD. Twenty patients will be recruited from the Developmental/Behavioral Pediatrics Clinic at the Munroe Meyer Institute at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Inclusion criteria are male and female children ages 4-8 years with a diagnosis of an ASD, including Pervasive Developmental Disorder NOS (PDD, NOS), Asperger's Syndrome, or Autistic Disorder, parent/guardian consent for participation, stable psychotropic medication treatment for at least 4 weeks, and a documented history of ISM based on parent-report, somnolog and Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), and a clinician rating of ≥4 (moderately ill) on the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) Scale. Patients will be excluded if they have been treated with Melatonin or Melatonin CR in the past month, failed treatment with Melatonin CR, or if they have a previously un-evaluated medical condition which may be causing the ISM. Following the completion of a somnolog and standardized questionnaires, the patients will be treated for 10-14 days with melatonin CR. Somnologs will be completed during treatment, and standardized parent questionnaires, CGI-S, and adverse event collection will be repeated at the end of Melatonin CR therapy. Response will be defined as a Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score of 1 or 2 (much or very much improved). These will be compared to baseline ratings. Following the completion of the study protocol, all patients will continue to be followed in the Developmental Pediatrics clinic. Data from this acute pilot trial can be used to evaluate the appropriateness of a larger study to determine optimal therapy for patients with ASD and ISM.","Inclusion Criteria:||Male or female children,|ages 4-8 years,|diagnosed with an ASD, including|Pervasive Developmental Disorder NOS (PDD, NOS),|Asperger's Syndrome, or|Autistic Disorder, and followed in the Munroe Meyer Developmental Pediatrics Clinic.

Cannabidiol (CBD), a compound originally derived from the cannabis plant but without the psychoactive effects found in cannabis, has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of children with severe epilepsy. Two non-controlled studies using CBD from local sources have demonstrated improvements in behavior in children with autism. Parents of autistic children have been using CBD products in an unregulated fashion with unknown dosing with anecdotal reports of improved behavior. This study will use EPIDIOLEX (EPX), a purified CBD oral solution that was FDA approved in June 2018 to treat severe forms of pediatric epilepsy. Study subjects will be 30 boys between 7 and 14 years of age with autism who have severe behavior problems. Every child will undergo baseline clinical evaluation, neuropsychological, behavioral, cognitive, and language testing, will have a test of brain wave activity (EEG) and a brain MRI scan. parents will complete questionnaires on various aspects of their child's behavior. Fifteen children will receive CBD for 8 weeks and 15 will receive a placebo that looks and tastes similar to the CBD (Period 1). All of the baseline tests and questionnaires will then be repeated. After a 4 week washout period, behavioral and cognitive tests and questionnaires will be repeated and then the treatments will be reversed (Period 2). At the end of 8 weeks, all of the baseline tests and questionnaires will be repeated. Study personnel and parents will be blinded to the treatment status of each child. Statistical analyses will be used to determine whether there are significant differences between baseline testing and results after placebo or CBD treatment. Types and severities of adverse events will be tracked to provide information about the safety and tolerability of CBD in this population. If CBD is found to be safe and effective in treating the behavioral problems associated with autism, this would be a major new tool in the treatment of those children that could lead to improved functioning and quality of life for the affected individuals and their families.","Inclusion Criteria:||Boys ages 7-14 years|Confirmed diagnosis of autism based on ADOS testing|Autism severity assessed as severe with substantial behavioral problems||Severity of symptoms will be based on a number of criteria:||Aggressive and/or self-injurious (SIBs) behaviors occur almost daily (more than 6 times per week) in any situation (home, school, clinic, etc.).|Frequent (daily), persistent (lasting at least 5-10 minutes and repeated through the day) stereotypies (repetitive behaviors such as hand flapping, running in circles, jumping repeatedly, waving fingers in front of eyes)|Pervasive hyperactivity (child is so physically active that he cannot sit for meals or school work, is moving all the time, jumping off furniture, climbing onto furniture, etc.)|One of more of the above activities is deemed to contribute significantly to child's inability to function by parental report and with clinician agreement based on history and/or direct observation||Exclusion Criteria:||the presence of epilepsy|a known genetic condition such as tuberous sclerosis|other significant health issues such as cardiac disease, presence of known congenital brain malformation, or a history of central nervous system infection.|children who are on anticonvulsant medications such as clobazam or valproic acid will also be excluded because of potential drug-drug interactions.

ASD affects approximately 1% of the general population (Elsabbagh et al., 2012). Studies of siblings of individuals with ASD show that ASD is present in 7-20% of the offspring in families where a child has had a diagnosis of ASD and this prevalence increases if there are two diagnosed children.||Several studies show the benefits of interventions targeting parents' interaction strategies in the early phases of development of infants at high risk for ASDs, in reducing the risk itself or its severity. Very early intervention, due to the presence of significant brain plasticity at these stages, may be particularly effective in changing these emerging trajectories, from a ""preventive intervention"" perspective that would aim to mitigate developmental risk and alter prodromal symptom trajectories, rather than eliminate a condition.||Our hypothesis is that the implementation of a specific therapeutic education program during a new pregnancy in the mother of a child with a diagnosis of ASD (MER Program) could improve the mother's well-being, increase parenting communication skills, and thereby improve interaction with the newborn at high risk for ASD.

It is usually first diagnosed in early childhood. Children with autism demonstrate repetitive behaviors or interests and deficits in social interaction, verbal communication, and nonverbal communication. In addition, they often have unusual responses to sensory experiences, such as certain sounds or the way objects look. Some symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, are also associated with autism. Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is used to treat ADHD. It works differently, however, than stimulant drugs and may help to reduce ADHD symptoms in children with autism. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of atomoxetine in treating children with ADHD symptoms associated with autism.||Potential participants will first attend a screening visit, which will include a psychiatric diagnostic interview, a practice session for swallowing pill capsules, a physical exam, an electrocardiogram (ECG), a blood test, and an assessment of pubertal stage. Females of childbearing age will also undergo a urine pregnancy test. In an initial double-blind study phase, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive either atomoxetine or placebo for 8 weeks. A baseline visit will include several rating scales, observations, and an interview to assess adaptive functioning. These measures and procedures will be used to keep track of symptoms, side effects, and behavior that could change during the study. Children who are assigned to placebo and do not notice an improvement in their ADHD symptoms will be given the opportunity to receive atomoxetine at the end of 8 weeks. Study visits will occur once a week for 4 weeks, and then every other week for the remainder of the 8 weeks. During these visits, many of the baseline questionnaires and interviews will be repeated. At the Week 8 visit, the physical exam, ECG, blood tests, and some baseline questionnaires will also be repeated. All children who respond well to atomoxetine may continue taking the drug for an additional 10 months. During this time, participants will report to the clinic once a month for the first 4 months, then once at the end of 7 months, and finally once at the end of 10 months.

The central goal of this project is to identify the mechanisms involved in the social-enhancing effect of dogs on children with ASD. The investigators will incorporate therapy dogs into an established evidence-based, group social skills instruction program for children with ASD, using a controlled experimental design with between- and within- subject comparisons and physiological and behavioral outcome measures. The investigators predict therapy dogs to have a specific and measurable effect on children's social behavior and that this effect is gained through identifiable mechanisms. Specifically, the investigators hypothesize that (1) an integration of therapy dogs into group social skills instruction will result in reduced stress and improved social behavior compare to traditional group instruction; (2) repeated exposure to the therapy dog across sessions will increase a child's preference for spending time with the dog and will increase the social-enhancing effects of the dog; and (3) that the therapists will experience less stress, engage in more social and affiliative behavior towards the children, and deliver higher quality instruction during sessions that include dogs. The investigators will enroll 72 children with ASD into group social skills instruction classes taught by 6 therapists. Each child will experience a 10-week, 8-student class in which either (a) the first 5 weeks will involve a therapy dog, (b) the last 5 weeks will involve the therapy dog, or (c) the class will not involve a therapy dog. The therapists will teach the courses repeatedly across the three cycles of the program with different children, rotating through each condition. Social behavior, stress behavior, heart rate, electrodermal activity, and salivary cortisol concentrations of children and therapists will be assessed and compared across conditions. The direction of the children's social behavior towards the dog and peers and the changes in quality of instruction of therapists during dog sessions compared to no-dog sessions will also be assessed.

ASDs are neurodevelopmental disorders that result in abnormalities of social and language development and are associated with rigid and repetitive behaviors. ASD prevalence may be as common as 1 in 110 and as many as 1/3 of these individuals have seizures. Abnormal electroencephalograms (EEGs) (without seizure activity) are even more prevalent (Spence & Schneider, 2009). In an ongoing study at the NIMH, approximately 50% of children without epilepsy had epileptiform discharges present on overnight EEG. The relationship between this abnormal activity and autism symptoms has not yet been studied; however, data from other epilepsy syndromes suggest that these epileptiform discharges contribute to behavioral and cognitive deficits. It is also unknown whether or not reduction of the epileptiform discharges will result in improved behavior and more rapid intellectual and social development in children with ASD. This pilot study is designed to address that question.||Study Population||100 children with ASDs including Autistic Disorder, Asperger's or PDD-NOS ages 3-10 will be screened to find up to 40 children with frequent epileptiform discharges noted on overnight EEG. Allowing for up to 20% drop out, we expect at least 32 to complete the study.||Design||The proposed investigation is a 9 month long trial with a 6 month double-blind placebo controlled trial of divalproex sodium (Depakote) and a 3 month open label extension phase. Prior to study entry, potential subjects will be evaluated with the standard PDN diagnostic/behavioral assessment (06-M-0065). Children meeting eligibility criteria will undergo an overnight EEG and those with frequent epileptiform discharges will be randomly assigned to receive divalproex sodium or placebo. Study drugs will be administered in a blinded fashion for 24 weeks with overnight EEG at 12 and 24 weeks. Biweekly then monthly visits with laboratory studies will monitor for behavioral improvement and for potential adverse effects. A 3 month open label extension phase follows.||Outcome Measures||The primary outcome measure will be EEG changes; tolerability and changes in behavioral symptoms will be exploratory secondary outcome assessments. It is hypothesized that divalproex will be superior to placebo in reducing epileptiform discharges on the EEG. In addition, exploratory analyses will investigate whether children who demonstrate improvements and even normalization of the EEG pattern will have more associated behavioral improvements than those for whom the EEG does not improve.","INCLUSION CRITERIA:||Have a diagnosis of Autistic Disorder, Asperger's syndrome, or Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS).|Are aged 3 to 10 years.|Weigh at least 12.5 kg.|Only children with frequent epileptiform EEG activity on the overnight EEG at NIH will be randomized to start study drug.

608,608,609,NCT02862340,,Children over 4 years with an autistic disorder of unknown etiology with the techniques currently available and accessible in routine diagnostics.,Genetic: Genetic test,Autistic disorder,Other,"Autism, ranked among the '' pervasive developmental disorders' (ASD), is characterized by disturbances in the areas of reciprocal social interaction, communication and behavior, interests and activities restricted, repetitive. Various studies indicate that autistic disorder is subjected to a genetic predisposition, most likely polygenic and heterogeneous. However, no major gene responsible for this disorder has yet been identified. Given the link between the Fragile X syndrome (the most common form of mental retardation (MR) hereditary) and autistic behavior, it seems interesting to look, also, a possible link to the molecular level. Among the proteins interacting with FMRP (absent protein in fragile X patients), the investigators were interested to CYFIP1, protein encoded by the gene CYFIP1 appears to be a good candidate gene involved in the RM and autism by its chromosomal position and function. As FMR1, CYFIP1 is expressed in the brain cortex, hippocampus and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. This protein co-localizes and interacts with Rac and FMRP, which are both involved in neurogenesis and cognitive development. In humans, the gene encoding CYFIP1 is located in the 15q11-q13. Now, the only autosomal abnormalities most frequently observed in autism are those involving the proximal 15q region, including duplications or 15q11-q13 triplications interstitial, of maternal origin.||These data suggest that an / or more autism genes responsible are probably present in the 15q11-q13 chromosomal region, although no gene has yet been identified. Thus, the study of the role of CYFIP1 gene in patients with autism spectrum disorders would most likely contributory.||The investigators wish to study the involvement of the 15q11-q13 chromosomal region and CYFIP1 gene in autistic disorder in a hundred patients from the Autism Resource Centre (ARC) Nice PACA antenna, over a two year period.||The diagnosis and assessment report of children likely to be included in this study will be conducted at ARC Nice. Balance sheets are made according to the recommendations of the High Authority of Health for diagnosis of infantile autism and PDD.

It is a double-blind control trial of sertraline (Zoloft), an anti-depressant typically used in the treatment of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and other conditions. The researchers are investigating the use of this selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in FXS because a retrospective study has shown significant improvements in language and decreases in autistic behavior. There is also emerging evidence regarding the stimulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the stimulation of neurogenesis when an SSRI is given early on in the development of animal models of Down syndrome. The researchers hope to see improvements in language stimulation, social gaze and social reciprocity, spatial attention, and a decrease in autistic behaviors.||The aim of this study is to carry out a double-blind placebo controlled trial of sertraline in children with FXS who are between the ages of 2 years and 5 years, 8 months old. At baseline, the researchers will assess behavioral and cognitive development. These children will be treated for six months with either sertraline or placebo. At the end of the six months, the researchers assess the same behavioral and cognitive measures as at the beginning of the study. The researchers will also assess the side effects of the sertraline treatment throughout the study.||On March 14, 2017 two secondary outcomes for each of the primary outcomes were added for clarification of measurements at baseline visit and at six-month visit.

ASD is being increasingly recognized as affecting a substantial amount of the pediatric population, with recent prevalence data showing 1 in 68 affected (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2010). Prior to the introduction of DSM-5, exclusion criteria precluded the diagnosis for ADHD when ASD was present (American Psychiatric Association 2013). Studies have shown that 41%-71% of children with ASD also meet criteria for ADHD, meaning up to 1% of the population may have comorbid ADHD and ASD (Goldstein & Schewbach 2004).||With the official recognition of comorbidity, treatment of comorbid ADHD when ASD is also present has been increasingly recognized as an important strategy in decreasing ADHD symptoms, and improving executive functioning and quality of life of those affected. Studies have indicated that some of the medications (methylphenidate, guanfacine XR and atomoxetine) commonly used to treat ADHD are effective and safe when used in comorbid ADHD and ASD (Ornstein & Kollins 2012; Ghuman et al. 2009; Handen et al. 2000; Quintana et al. 1995; Posey et al. 2004; Scahill et al. 2015; M. et al. 2012). While amphetamine class compounds are amongst the first line of treatment in ADHD, the lack of studies in this population has discouraged their use in subjects with comorbid ADHD and ASD.||The lack of safety and efficacy data is problematic as it limits therapeutic options for the population of subjects with ADHD and ASD. Amphetamines and methylphenidate medications are equally considered first line treatment options for ADHD (CADDRA 2011). Some subjects may preferentially respond to one group of medications over another, therefore it is important to have clear safety and efficacy data for both therapeutic options.||A retrospective chart review of this population indicates that treatment is started with methylphenidate versus combined amphetamine/dextroamfetamine at a ratio of 2.78:1 (Stigler et al. 2004). Due to the availability of evidence of efficacy in this comorbid population, clinicians may choose to skip to what is considered a second line medication for ADHD symptomatology rather than using LDX (or another amphetamine-based ADHD medication such as dexedrine or Adderall XR) that may have a larger effect size for treating these symptoms.||LDX has been shown to be an effective treatment for ADHD in subjects 6 and above. With long lasting effectiveness shown to last up to 14 hours, it could potentially improve ADHD symptoms and overall quality of life for children and adolescents with ADHD and ASD in home, school and after-school functioning.||The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LDX in treating ADHD when ASD is co-morbid.","Inclusion Criteria:||Male or female subject aged 6-12 years at the time of consent/assent.|Subjects parent(s) or legally authorized representative (LAR) must provide signature of informed consent, and there must be documentation of assent (if applicable) by the subject in accordance with the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guideline E6 (1996), any updates or revisions, and applicable regulations, before completing any study related procedures.|Subject and parent(s)/LAR are willing and able to comply with all of the requirements defined in the protocol.|Subject meets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-V) criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD combined presentation, inattentive presentation or hyperactive/impulsive presentation based on history and a minimum ADHD-RS score of 32 and a minimum CGI-S of 4 at baseline.|Subject meets DSM-V criteria for a diagnosis of ASD-level 1 based on history and Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS-2).|Subject has an SRS-2 total score of ≥ 70.|Subject has a Clinical Global Impressions - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score ≥ 4 at the baseline visit (visit 2)|Subject has a blood pressure measurement within 95th percentile for age, and sex (Appendix 1,1.1,2 & 2.2).

One such agent is minocycline (MC), a drug traditionally used as an antibiotic.

Generally, mirror responses are larger upon the observation of actions accompanied by relevant information for the observer, such as direct eye contact from the actor. In other words, 'mirroring' is adaptively modulated according to the social salience of the observed actions (i.e. it is socially adaptive).||Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are known to endure difficulties with correctly recognizing eye contact as a communicative cue. Instead, they tend to experience eye contact as stressful and arousing. It is therefore hypothesized that, upon the observation of actions combined with salient gaze cues from the actor, these mirroring processes will not be adaptively modulated in participants with ASD.||As appropriate processing of eye contact is a key aspect of (non-verbal) communicative behavior, the investigator will investigate the efficacy of a single dose of intranasal oxytocin administration for enhancing socially-adaptive mirroring in ASD. Oxytocin is a neuropeptide that acts as a regulator social brain areas. On a behavioral level, it is known to enhance the saliency of observed social cues and to improve prosocial behavior. As such, it is regarded a promising intervention for alleviating the social and communicative deficits in ASD.","Inclusion Criteria:||Male|Young adults (between 18 - 35 y/o)|Right-handed|Official diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders (for ASD participants)||Exclusion Criteria:||Female|Left-handed|Any neuro(psycho)logical / psychiatric illness (for healthy controls)|Motor dysfunctions of the hands / arms|Any contradiction to TMS research as assessed with the TMS screening list: no metal objects in the body (e.g. pacemaker, coronary bypass clips, implants, medication pumps, ...), history of brain trauma in the past (e.g. meningitis, epilepsy, surgery, ...) or history of drug and/or alcohol abuse.",25.0,Actual,Male,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,No,Oxytocin (OXT) spray|Placebo (PL) spray,A single dose (24IU) of nasal spray (3 puffs of 4IU per nostril) will be administered before the assessment of the neurophysiological measures.|A single dose (24IU) of nasal spray (3 puffs of 4IU per nostril) will be administered before the assessment of the neurophysiological measures.,Oxytocin|Placebo,Drug|Other,"February 5, 2020",Actual,"February 3, 2020",OTHER,KU Leuven,Leuven,Belgium,Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,649,,35 Years,18 Years,To Mirror or Not to Mirror Upon Perceived Eye Contact?

ASD is defined by impairments in social-communication as well as the presence of restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. ASD is frequently associated with co-occurring language delays. Currently the only well-accepted treatment for core ASD symptoms is behavior therapy such as Applied Behavioral Analysis and Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention. There is no US Food and Drug Administration approved medical therapy that addresses core ASD symptoms or the pathophysiological processes that underlie ASD.||The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a liquid form of leucovorin calcium on social and communication impairments in very young children with ASD. Participants entered into the trial will have delayed language and moderate ASD symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that leucovorin calcium will significantly improve social communication as well as core and associated behavioral symptoms of ASD, and be well-tolerated with no significant adverse effects, in young children with ASD.||To assess whether the liquid form of leucovorin calcium is superior to placebo, the investigators will study 80 children across two sites, between the ages of 2.5 and 5 years, with confirmed ASD and known social and communication delays at baseline. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive active treatment or placebo for 12 weeks under double-blind conditions. At the end of 12 weeks, all participants will receive active treatment for 12 weeks. Language skills and social communication abilities will be measured at screening and after each treatment arm in order to determine if the supplement positively influences social communication. Additionally, the investigators will measure changes in neural pathways using either magnetoencephalography at Phoenix Children's Hospital or functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy at State University of New York, Downstate. While these measures will be considered exploratory, they will be important to begin to elucidate the neuronal mechanisms underlying leucovorin's impact.","Inclusion Criteria:||1.

These evaluations may take up to an hour to complete. In addition, subjects will be asked to participate in a psychiatric interview designed to determine the child's diagnosis and current problem areas. The subject's parent will also be asked to fill out psychiatric questionnaires. The interview and questionnaires may take up to 4 hours to complete.||Second, urine and blood samples will be needed for routine tests two times during this study (before any study related tests are done, and at the end of the study). Two teaspoons of blood will be drawn each time. The urine sample will be analyzed in order to assess kidney function and to screen for the presence of drugs (such as cocaine, marijuana, heroin, etc.). A positive drug screen would result in the inability of the child to participate in this study. Drug screen results will be kept confidential. In addition, an electrocardiogram will be performed to determine heartbeat.||Lastly, a pregnancy test will be conducted on the urine sample if the child is female and has reached puberty. The child should not be in this study if she is pregnant or a nursing mother. A positive urine pregnancy test would cause the child to be removed from the study. If the child is sexually active, she must be using an effective method of birth control during her participation in this study. Acceptable methods of birth control are oral contraceptive medications (the administration of which must be parentally supervised), IUD, depot medication and tubal ligation.||Subjects will be assigned by chance to receive either the active medication (Galantamine) or placebo (sugar pill) for 12 weeks, much like the flip of a coin. Neither the parent/child nor the investigator will know which of the two treatments the child is receiving.

During these visits the study psychiatrist will ask the parent for feedback on his/her child's condition and any changes that may be related to the medication, including possible side effects, such as nausea and headaches, and will check the child's condition. The psychiatrist will also record his/her weight.

A number of researchers have suggested that the neuropeptide oxytocin may be implicated in the etiology of autism.||Given the likely possibility of dysregulated oxytocin in autism, the goal of this pilot study is to investigate the long-term therapeutic effects of oxytocin in the treatment of autism. One practical issue with oxytocin is that it does not exist in a pill form. Only the intravenous form is available in the United States and this form may or may not pass the blood-brain barrier. In addition, intravenous oxytocin is not practical for treatment studies. One alternative is intranasal oxytocin; this form of administration is known to pass the blood-brain barrier, and it is easy for participants to self-administer. Although not available in the United States, we are in the process of receiving an Investigational New Drug exemption for its use and can import it from Europe.||Thus, this pilot investigation will explore daily intranasal oxytocin in the treatment of autism. Also, there are very few, if any, outcome measures to assess social functioning in the ""real world"" in the context of clinical trials; yet, this is a major target for intervention, especially in autism. Thus, a final goal of this study will be to explore the use of Event Contingent Recording to index changes in social functioning and affect. Event Contingent Recording is a methodology developed by personality/social psychologists, which allows participants to report on symptoms, affect, and behavior close in time to experience. In addition, to enabling more sensitive assessments, this methodology allows for the assessment of more diverse (e.g., at home versus work) and more detailed measurements of mood and behavior.||Finally, a portion of this study aims to perform gene expression profiling using fresh whole blood to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying oxytocin therapy and oxytocin efficacy in adults with high functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome. The systemic effects of oxytocin therapy and the molecular basis for a positive treatment response to oxytocin are not well understood. An understanding of the former may help predict those persons who may suffer side-effects from treatment and the latter may help provide easily accessible peripheral biomarkers that could predict treatment response.","Inclusion Criteria:||Male or female outpatients 18 to 60 years of age.|Meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision.

An increase of BDNF levels (by genetic manipulations or pharmacological agents) leads to delayed onset of Rett syndrome-like symptoms in experimental models; rescued gait/mobility, improved quality of life and increased survival rates.||Copaxone treatment by subcutaneous injection caused elevation of BDNF levels. Quantitative immunofluorescence assays showed about a twofold increase in neuronal expression of BDNF following Copaxone treatment.||We expect that an increase in BDNF levels with Copaxone administration will stimulate communication between brain cells (synaptic maturation), which will lead to amelioration of symptoms (motor functions/gait, cognitive functions, breathing, encephalopathy and improve quality of life) for girls with Rett syndrome.","Inclusion Criteria:||Female patients with genetically confirmed Rett Syndrome (RTT)|Age: 10 or more years old.

There is no described human neuroserpin deficiency phenotype. The neuroserpin knockout mouse phenotype also suggests a possible overlap with autism. Neuroserpin could contribute directly at the synapse or through altered neuron migration during early development leading to the ""underconnectivity"" that underlies autism by potentially contributing to the excess of short connections and not enough long ones seen in autistic brains, possibly due to an imbalance in pruning of neurons and synapses early in life.

Despite the high prevalence and potential effect of metabolic abnormalities on the health of persons with WS, their full phenotypic range, potential causal factors (either genetic and/or hormonal) along with their impact on other aspects of health (such as risk of falls and fractures or interaction with emotional behavioral concerns) remain incompletely characterized. The purpose of the current study in a large cohort of subjects with WS is to: collect further information to characterize the timing of onset and distribution of body fat; better characterize hormonal status of WS subjects; and screen for genetic variation using single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) analysis that could elucidate genetic contributors to the lipedema phenotype as well as the other observed metabolic and bone abnormalities.","Williams Syndrome Strength, Hormones, Activity & Adiposity, DNA Programming, Eating Study",pober.barbara@mgh.harvard.edu|tstanley@partners.org,"Barbara Pober, MD|Takara Stanley, MD","June 30, 2021",Anticipated,Williams Syndrome|Lipedema,Syndrome|Lipedema|Williams Syndrome|Williams Syndrome,,,,,,732,"For this study, we will identify 40 children (4 to 18 years old) with autism who also have serious behavioral problems.

This exploratory or discovery study will use blood genomic profiles before and after risperidone treatment in children with autism and severe behavioral difficulties to determine if the profiles can predict response to treatment. The ultimate goal of this line of research is to develop methods to predict which medications work for which child before initiating treatment, to predict which child might develop particular side effects, and to identify new treatment targets for future medication development.||Risperidone will be started at 0.5 mg at bedtime for 4 days and, if the current dosage is tolerated as evidenced by no more than mild sedation, no EPS or other moderate to severe AEs, and if there are continued behavioral symptoms, the dose will be increased to 1 mg at bedtime for an additional 4 days. If tolerated and indicated, 0.5 mg will be added in the AM for a daily total of 1.5 mg. After that, dosages may be increased if there does not appear to be an adequate clinical response. Dosage will not be increased if there are side effects (e.g. excessive sedation, salivation, EPS, lactation) and may be decreased if it is not tolerated. If the investigator determines that a significant adverse reaction occurs or if the subject or his or her family wants to stop the study, the medication will be tapered or stopped depending on the dose and reason for stopping and the subject will be offered alternative treatment at the M.I.N.D.

This widespread use reflects the hypothesis that many cases of ASD are caused by exposure to thimerosal, an ethylmercury-based compound used previously in the US as a vaccine preservative for routine childhood immunizations. The prevalent use of chelation therapy stands in stark contrast with the lack of scientific or clinical evidence of efficacy, and creates a public health imperative for empiric data. Thus we propose a controlled trial of the effects of chelation on the core behavioral symptoms and overall functioning of children with ASD. The present investigation is a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study of the oral chelating agent meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA; succimer) among 120 children, ages four to ten years, who meet criteria for ASD. Pre- and post-treatment behavioral ratings will be used to evaluate the efficacy of chelation. In addition, children will undergo comprehensive medical history, physical examination and laboratory analyses.||Our objective is to quantify differences in behavioral functioning between the chelation treatment group and the placebo control group. Analysis of mercury levels before and during the course of treatment will be used to confirm the expected DMSA-induced excretion of mercury and to identify differences among children in the extent of excretion.

Due to the lack of known treatments for autism, many parents seek complementary and alternative medical (CAM) therapies hoping to help their affected child. Methylcobalamin (methyl B12) is a commonly used CAM treatment that has anecdotal reports of remarkable clinical improvements with few side effects. Prior studies have found that children with autism have deficiencies in key metabolites and antioxidants which can be caused by methyl B12 deficiency; additional studies have shown that methyl B12 normalizes deficiencies in these metabolites and antioxidants. Based on these reports, a pilot study was conducted at UC Davis on the effect of methyl B12 on the behavioral and metabolic measures in children with autism. The preliminary results of 29 subjects revealed a subgroup of 9 responders to clinical behavior assessments. These responders also demonstrated significant improvement on the plasma measures of antioxidant capacity, suggesting methyl B12 improves symptoms in a subgroup of children with autism by increasing key antioxidants. The current study will have an 8 week double blind design with 50 subjects, designed to evaluate improvements from methyl B12 by using behavioral assessments and analysis of specific metabolites in the subjects' blood. This study will determine whether methyl B12 will lead to benefits in any of the core features of autism, and will examine metabolic changes with the hope of potentially identifying a biomarker for treatment response in a subgroup of subjects.","Inclusion Criteria:||Diagnosis of DSM IV defined autism and meets cut off on Autism Diagnostic Inventory-Revised (ADI-R) and/or the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS)|Age 3 through 7 years|IQ of 50 or above|Parental agreement to continue present dietary, behavioral or psychotropic drug treatment but not change treatment during 8 week intervention|Willingness to have blood drawn, without the use of a sedative prescription from the study doctor||Exclusion Criteria:||Bleeding disorder|Cancer|Seizure disorder|Fragile X or other known genetic cause of autism|Perinatal brain injury (i.e.: cerebral palsy)|Other serious medical illnesses|Current use of any B12 supplement",57.0,Actual,All,No,,Active|Placebo,75 µg/Kg subcutaneously injected once every 3 days|placebo,Methyl B12|Placebo,Drug|Dietary Supplement,"February 24, 2017",Actual,"January 4, 2017",OTHER,"University of California, San Francisco",San Francisco,United States,UCSF,779,California,7 Years,3 Years,Double Blind Placebo Controlled Trial of Methyl B12 on Behavioral and Metabolic Measures in Children With Autism,"University of California, San Francisco","University of California, San Francisco",Completed,No,Phase 2|Phase 3,October 2013,Actual,"PI assesses subject's change using the CGI-I measure.

Melatonin produced in the pineal gland helps regulate human circadian rhythms including sleep-wake, and is considered as the best measure of circadian rhythms.||Several studies revealed that plasmatic and urinary nocturnal levels of melatonin are significantly lower in individuals with autism (in particular, in prepubertal children) compared to typically developing individuals. In addition, this reduction in nocturnal melatonin was significantly associated with the severity of communication and social interaction impairments, especially in verbal communication and play. Finally, diurnal excretion of melatonin was also found to be decreased in individuals with autistic disorder.||Given these results, administration of melatonin could serve, at least in prepubertal children wih autism, to normalize physiological, developmental and behavioral processes that are influenced by this pineal hormone. A randomized clinical trial is therefore necessary to establish potential therapeutic efficacy of melatonin in autistic disorder and to specify its dose-effect relation. This is the first clinical trial studying the melatonin dose-effect in autism.","Inclusion Criteria:||Prepubertal males with autism from 6 to 8 years old, according to the diagnostic criteria of autistic disorder of the WHO (CIM-10), American (DSM-IV-TR) and French (CFTMEA) classifications.|Verbal language level required for the ADOS (Module 1) (i.e., no verbal language as defined by the ADI-R (autism diagnostic interview-revised) scale).|Written informed consent of the parents or the legal representative.||Non-inclusion Criteria:||Treatment by benzodiazepines.|Treatment by anticonvulsant drugs.|Treatment by serotoninergic products.|Hypersensitivity reaction to the active substance or one of the excipients of the product.|Patient with hereditary galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or malabsorption syndrome of glucose and galactose.|Children who are not able to swallow tablets.",34.0,Actual,Male,No,,10 mg melatonin|2 mg melatonin|4 mg melatonin|2 mg melatonin|4 mg melatonin|Placebo,Placebo tablets of Circadin®,melatonin|Placebo,Drug|Drug,"September 5, 2013",Estimate,"September 4, 2013",OTHER,Rennes University Hospital,Paris|Poitiers|Reims|Rennes,France|France|France|France,Service de Psychiatrie de l'Enfant et de l'Adolescent - Hôpital de la Pitié-Salpêtrière|Centre Hospitalier Spécialisé Henri Laborit|Service de Psychothérapie de l'Enfant et de l'Adolescent - Hôpital Robert Debré|Pôle de Psychiatrie de l'Enfant et de l'Adolescent - Centre Hospitalier Guillaume Régnier,833,,8 Years,6 Years,Melatonin Dose-effect Relation in Childhood Autism,Rennes University Hospital,"Centre Hospitalier Guillaume Régnier, RENNES|Rennes University Hospital",Completed,Yes,Phase 2,July 2013,Actual,,Severity of autistic disorder,6 weeks after the beginning of the treatment.,,Sponsor,,833,,,,,,,"January 23, 2011",Actual,"September 27, 2021",Child|Adult|Older Adult,"May 28, 2010",Estimate,"May 27, 2010","May 27, 2010",Observational,"December 16, 2021",,No

The core symptoms of ASD are deficits in social communication and the presence of repetitive and restricted behaviours and interests, including sensory anomalies. Currently, there are no effective medical treatments for the core symptoms of ASD, and families frequently use costly non evidence based interventions. Developing drugs for ASD has been challenging because of a limited understanding of its underlying pathophysiology(ies), and difficulties modelling it in vitro and in vivo.||A recent study from EU-AIMS reported, for the first time in ASD, that differences in E-I balance can be 'shifted' using a GABA acting drug (riluzole), and that abnormalities in functional connectivity can be 'normalised' by targeting E-I, even in adults. This offers promise that drugs targeting specific parts of the GABA pathway may improve symptoms.||The aim of the investigator's project is to conduct a double-blind Randomized Control Trial (RCT) focused on GABA/glutamate equilibrium, to assess the efficacy of a drug that targets core and/or comorbid symptoms in ASD. Arbaclofen is a selective GABA-B receptor agonist and augments GABA-ergic activity, inhibits presynaptic release of glutamate, inhibits postsynaptic transmission, and modulates intracellular signalling. Through elevation of GABA-ergic inhibitory activity, Arbaclofen may act to alleviate ASD symptoms with social anxiety and emotional hyperarousal.||Hypothesis: Arbaclofen will be superior to placebo in improving social function as measured by the Vineland-3 social domain.","Inclusion Criteria:||Signed Written Informed Consent||Participants or their legal representative must have signed and dated an IRB/IEC approved written informed consent form in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines.

Though research progress pertaining to FraX has been extraordinary in many areas, many critical gaps in knowledge remain. In particular, there is a dearth of information on treatments designed to address the often-serious cognitive and behavioral symptoms of FraX. Like many other developmental disorders, descriptions of treatments for FraX that do exist in the literature are primarily derived from uncontrolled case studies or series, with both pharmacological and behavioral interventions targeted to symptoms associated with phenomenologically defined ""co-morbid"" diagnoses such as AD/HD, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or anxiety disorders. These circumstances are suboptimal as such symptom-based treatments represent a low level of specificity with respect to the underlying pathogenesis of cognitive and behavioral problems. Accordingly, new research to develop more effective, disease-specific treatments for persons with FraX is greatly needed.||Converging evidence from our research group and others strongly support a hypothesis of functional cholinergic deficits contributing to cognitive-behavioral dysfunction in FraX. This evidence includes: (1) abnormalities of cholinergic pathway function and neurochemistry observed with functional MRI and 1H-MRS, respectively, in FraX, (2) an analysis of FMR1 expression during human fetal development indicating particularly high expression in cholinergic brain regions, (3) cholinergic system abnormalities detected in the mouse and fly models of FraX, (4) an analysis of the specific profile of cognitive and behavioral deficits in FraX in relation to current knowledge of cholinergic system functions, and, (5) significant improvements in cognition and behavior observed in 12 individuals with FraX during an open-label trial of donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor. Accordingly, the proposed project will consist of a double blind, placebo controlled trial of donepezil in 50 individuals with FraX, ages 12 to 29 years. The primary hypothesis is that subjects receiving donepezil will show greater improvements in specific measures of behavior and cognition, relative to the placebo group. In addition to direct benefit to persons affected by FraX, findings from the proposed research are likely to be highly relevant to subgroups of (currently) idiopathic developmental disorders, such as autism, that might share common pathophysiological mechanisms of disease with FraX. Such shared mechanisms could occur through intersecting pathways involving FMR1 protein function or as a result of similarities in the contribution of cholinergic dysfunction to cognitive and behavioral disability.","Inclusion Criteria:||confirmed genetic diagnosis of fragile X syndrome|age >=12, <=29|Verbal IQ >= 50, <=75|Tanner pubertal stage >= 3||Exclusion Criteria:||Current or lifetime DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychotic disorder, NOS based upon reported history|Poorly controlled seizure disorder or taking more than one anticonvulsant (subjects cannot be prescribed carbamazepine, phenytoin, or phenobarbital due to potential interaction effects with donepezil).

Few epidemiological studies have estimated the frequency of osteoporosis in girls with RETT syndrome and showed that they are more exposed then children with other neuro-developmental diseases with a same degree of neurological handicap. However, the mechanisms that lead to early osteoporosis in RETT syndrome remain unknown. Mutations in the MECP2 gene are found in 95% of RETT patients and preliminary experimental studies have shown that this can lead to abnormal expression of the gene that codes for osteoprotegerin, a protein implicated in bone remodelling by interacting with RANK-ligand.||In order to identify risk factors of osteoporosis in RETT syndrome and to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms the study protocol includes:||Clinical evaluation of bone health (history of bone fractures, pain, nutritional status, pubertal stage, daily caloric/calcium intake, anti-epileptic drugs, walking ability, vitamin D satus)|evaluation of the mineral density at the lumber spine using DEXA|measuring concentrations of osteoprotegerin and RANK-ligand",Osteoporosis in RETT Syndrome,,,"June 6, 2014",Actual,RETT Syndrome With Proven MECP2 Mutation,Syndrome|Osteoporosis|Rett Syndrome|Rett Syndrome,,Single Group Assignment,None (Open Label),Diagnostic,,896,"Disruptive behaviors are very common in children and youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

The population prevalence of autism is approximately 1 in 1000 (GILLBERG and WING, 1999) and the ratio of affected males to females is 4:1 (FOMBONNE, 1999). Although typically considered a childhood disorder, most persons with autism experience marked functional impairment throughout their lives. Follow-up studies of children with autism show that only 5%-10% become independent as adults, 25% progress but still require supervision, and the remaining continue to be severely impaired and in need of institutionalized care (WING, 1989). Thus, the syndrome represents a substantial public health problem with tragic cost to the individual, the family, and the community.||It is a randomized, double blind flexible dose study with parallel groups, controlled, fluoxetine versus placebo.||The final efficacy evaluation will be done after 6 months of treatment; Nine obligatory visits are planned Patients will be assessed at the following visits: base-line inclusion (D-15), and 2, 4, ,12, ,20, 22, 24 25, 26 weeks. At the 24 W visit, the final efficacy will be performed and medication will be tapered over a maximum period of 2 weeks. The final safety assessment will be performed at 26W.||BRAIN IMAGING PROTOCOL :||We will assess the resting state regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in autistic children using labeled water and PET, as it is still the most reliable and least invasive method. In addition, an anatomical and functional MRI will be performed in all children, the same day. Brain imaging studies will be performed at the Service HOSPITALIER Frederic JOLIOT (ORSAY, France) under Dr Monica ZILBOVICIUS responsibility.||Each brain imaging examination will be performed twice: 1) at time zero (T0) - before the beginning of the treatment and 2) six month later, after placebo or sertraline treatment.||Functional imaging in the resting state - Positron emission tomography :||Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) will be measured on a Siemens ECAT HR+ camera. Attenuation-corrected data are reconstructed into 63 slices, with a resulting resolution of 4.5 mm full-width-at-half-maximum. Fifteen seconds before each scan, 7 mCi of H215O is administrated by bolus injection. Data are collected during 80 s. All rCBF examinations will be performed at rest during sleep induced by premedication (4 mg/kg of pentobarbital). We have previously reported that this premedication has no effects on absolute rCBF values and regional distribution.||Anatomical MRI:||A high resolution MRI of the brain will be obtained in all children witg a 1.5 Tesla Signa General Electric scanner using a 3D T1-weighted FSPGR sequence (TR/TE/TI/NEX: 10.5/2.2/600/1, flip angle 10°, matrix size 256 x 192, yielding 124 axial slices and a thickness of 1.2 mm, field of view 22 cm). The acquisition duration is 6 minutes. In addition, FLAIR and T2 axial and coronal sequences will be also acquired.||Biological measures:||Blood sample procedure for whole blood serotonin: patients must follow a diet poor in tryptophan during two days before the blood sampling. Blood sample will be performed without premedication between nine and 11 AM. Blood will be withdrawn into tubes containing EDTA acid and aprotinin. Platelet- poor plasma (containing up to 0.1% of the original platelet count as assessed by contrast phase microscopy) is obtained within 2 hours by centrifugation (2000g, 4C, 15 mn) and frozen as 0.5mL aliquots at -80C until assess (blind procedures will be used).

Approximately 10 Canadian children per 10 000 live births suffer from the disorder, which is three to four times more common in males than in females. It is characterized by social and and communicative deficits and restricted, repetitive interests and behaviours. Most autistic children are delayed in the acquisition of both verbal and non-verbal communication skills and many never develop useful language. Three-quarters of autistic children have mild to severe mental retardation and a quarter develop seizures during later childhood or adolescence. Its etiology is heterogenous and there is no cure. Although behaviour therapy is an important tool in management, pharmacotherapy remains a necessity for many children. Current therapy is limited to antipsychotic drugs that can carry an unacceptable risk of chronic neurotoxicity (tardive dyskinesia) or tricyclic antidepressants that have undesireble cardiovascular effects.

SPECIFIC AIMS||To investigate the safety of clinical use of ziprasidone in children|To investigate the dosages that have been employed clinically.||II. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE||Ziprasidone, a recently released atypical agent is likely to be as effective as other neuroleptics in treating psychiatric symptoms in children, but may have the considerable health advantage of not causing weight gain. Ziprasidone administration has been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval (mean=20 msec), an electrocardiographic measure of ventricular repolarization (Federal Drug Administration, 2000). There are no reports regarding the use of ziprasidone in autism, and data regarding the safety and efficacy of ziprasidone in children is extremely limited. The only published study of ziprasidone in children found that it was safe and effective in treating Tourette's syndrome in children aged 7 to 17 years of age (Sallee et al, 2000). Because children are being treated with ziprasidone despite a paucity of safety data, it is important to begin to collect and review available data, including that from clinical usage. Some children who receive services within the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Services of Drexel University College of Medicine have been treated with ziprasidone. The charts of the children and adolescents will contain data regarding exposure to ziprasidone and laboratory data and ECG's that can be reviewed to determine whether ziprasidone treatment has been associated with changes in weight, laboratory values and ECG's. We propose to review the charts of patients who have been treated with our services since March 1, 2001 XXX because such patients may have been exposed to ziprasidone (ziprasidone received FDA approval on February 5, 2001).||III. DESIGN AND METHODS||A. Setting: The setting for this study will be the Specialty Clinic for Pervasive Developmental Disorders, part of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic at Eastern Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute.||B. Subjects: Subjects will be 15 children and adolescents who meet the DSM-IV Criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorder.||C. Design: This is a 6-week pilot study employing open treatment with ziprasidone. Subjects will be rated at baseline and thereafter assessed weekly.||D. Medication: Subjects will be treated openly with ziprasidone. Should untoward effects occur, the dosage of the medication will be reduced or the medication will be discontinued, as clinically appropriate. Subjects will not receive other concomitant psychotropic medication during the study. Medication will be taken concomitant with food.||Ziprasidone Dosing Strategy: Ziprasidone tablets (5, 10, and 20 mg) will be employed for the study. The dosage range for ziprasidone will be 5 mg/day to 40 mg/day. Every effort will be made to reach and maintain a therapeutic dosage by week four of the treatment phase.||For subjects who weigh less than 25 kg, starting dosage will be 5 mg/every other day. After 3 days, the dosage can be increased to 5 mg. By week 2, subjects can be increased to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 20 mg increments weekly.|For subjects who weigh greater than 25 kg, the starting dosage will be 5 mg/day. After three days, the dosage can be increased to 10 mg/day. By week two, subjects can be increased to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 20 mg increments weekly as needed.||Note: Should 5 mg tablets not be available, the dosing schedule will be altered to have a starting dosage of 10 mg, and dosage increases will be made in 10 mg increments.||F. Measures||Primary efficacy measure: The Clinical Global Impressions (CGI; Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The efficacy of treatments can be judged on their ability to enhance global functioning, an assessment that is particularly relative in a pilot study. The CGI consists of three global scales measuring severity of illness, global improvement, and drug effect, and has been useful in measuring drug treatment effect in this population (see Campbell and Palij, 1985). The PI and another trained rater will complete this scale. Although only members of the research team generally complete this scale, it will additionally be completed by the subject's parent/caretaker. Having it completed by the parent/caretaker will take only minutes and may result in useful data. This measure will be completed weekly beginning at baseline.|Secondary efficacy measure: Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale (Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The CPRS was developed by the Psychopharmacology Branch of the NIMH to rate childhood psychopathology. Each of the items is rated from ""1"" (not present) to ""7"" (extremely severe). The first 28 items of this scale require no verbal response on the part of the subject, making them appropriate for rating children and adolescents with Pervasive Developmental Disorder. Of these 28 items, 14 are particularly relevant in autism (see Campbell and Palij, 1985): they assess the symptoms for which drug treatment is indicated including hyperactivity, aggression, self-abusive behavior, temper tantrums, lability of mood, irritability, social withdrawal, and stereotypies. A composite sum of these 14 items, the CPRS-14, will be constructed and employed as a secondary outcome measure, a procedure used by a number of investigators (Anderson et al, 1989; Campbell et al, 1986, 1989, 1993; Findling et al, 1997; Sanchez et al, 1996). We analyzed our data using the CPRS-14; the ICC was 0.8978. In addition, 4 factors derived from these 14 items will be examined. They include: autism, anger/uncooperativeness, hyperactivity, and speech deviance (Overall and Campbell, 1988). This measure will be completed at baseline and at the end of treatment.|Safety measures: (1) A physical exam will be completed at baseline. (2) Height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse will be obtained and recorded at baseline and at each visit during the study. (3) The following laboratory measures will be obtained at baseline and repeated at the end of the treatment phase: complete blood count with differential, liver functions, and electrocardiogram. Serum prolactin will be obtained at baseline and at the end of the treatment phase. These laboratory studies will be repeated at the end of the treatment phase of the study. Any other clinically appropriate tests and evaluations will also be completed whenever needed.||Untoward effects will be measured and recorded at each visit employing the following measures: (1) Dosage Record and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (DOTES); (2) Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale (TESS); (3) Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) (all from Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985); and (4) the Neurologic Rating Scale (Simpson and Angus, 1970). The DOTES and TESS measure a wide range of possible untoward effects. The AIMS measures dyskinesias. The Neurologic Rating Scale measures other forms of extrapyramidal effects that can occur with neuroleptics such as dystonias, parkinsonian effects, and akathisia.||G. Procedures: All patients appropriate to the study and their parent/caretakers will be approached and informed consent and assent (in subjects under 14 years) will be obtained. Subjects meeting the Inclusion Criteria, but not the Exclusion Criteria, will enter the baseline period of the study.||Baseline (week 0): Subjects will be rated at baseline employing the CGI and the CPRS.||End of Treatment (week 6): At the end of the treatment period, subjects will again be rated employing the CGI and the CPRS (selected items).||In addition, each subject will be rated on the CGI at each visit so that data from the last visit is available should the subject terminate the study prematurely. If it is known that a subject will terminate the study at a visit before week 6, the subject will be rated with the CGI and the CPRS at that visit.||All safety measures will be completed at each visit. Laboratory measures and EKG will be obtained in the morning.||I. Analysis: This is a pilot study whose purpose is to get initial safety and efficacy data with ziprasidone in children with autism. We will perform an ANOVA, repeated measures, for CGI severity scores, the CPRS-14 and the CPRS factors. Similar analyses will be performed for safety measures including for weight, prolactin and other laboratory measures, and EKG indices.","Inclusion Criteria:||Diagnosis of autism (DSM-IV) made by a boarded child and adolescent psychiatrist.|Males and females.|Aged 12 to 18 years.|Clinical judgment that medication treatment for autism is indicated.||Exclusion Criteria:||Major medical problems including cardiac, liver, endocrine, or renal diseases.|History of seizure disorder or gross neurological deficit.|Baseline QTC greater than 425 msec.|Concomitant treatment with psychotropic medication.|History of prior exposure to ziprasidone.",15.0,Actual,All,No,,1 Open Label,"Ziprasidone 40mg to 60mg per day, individually titrated",Ziprasidone,Drug,"June 17, 2010",Estimate,"June 15, 2010",OTHER,Drexel University College of Medicine,Philadelphia,United States,Drexel University College of Medicine at Friends Hospital,938,Pennsylvania,18 Years,12 Years,Ziprasidone in Children With Autism: A Pilot Study,Drexel University,Drexel University College of Medicine,Completed,Yes,Phase 2,June 2005,Actual,,Clinical Global Impressions,Week 6,,,,938,,,,20 minute video of a therapist-child interaction in the clinic with a standard set of age-appropriate toys.|Parent report of child's expressive vocabulary and prelinguistic communication skills,Expressive vocabulary of the child as measured by transcribing and coding a 20 minute video of a therapist-child interaction in the clinic with a standard set of age-appropriate toys.|MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (MCDI) (Child),Two months after the start of the study|Two months after the start of the study,August 2015,Actual,July 2021,Child,"December 17, 2015",Estimate,"December 8, 2015","December 16, 2015",Interventional,"December 16, 2021",,No

Currently, there is no FDA approved medical therapy that addresses either core ASD symptoms or pathophysiological processes associated with ASD. For example, the two FDA approved antipsychotic medications for treating ASD are indicated for symptoms associated with ASD, not core ASD symptoms. Based on strong preliminary evidence, this study aims to improve core ASD symptoms with folinic acid. Two biological mechanisms for response to the intervention are proposed and investigated in this study.||Folate is an essential B vitamin required for normal neurodevelopment. Folinic acid is a reduced form of folate that has been shown to improve both the metabolic and core symptoms associated with ASD in an open-label study and large case-series. This study will extend this preliminary evidence to demonstrate clinical efficacy of folinic acid in a double-blind placebo-controlled manner while also evaluating the biological mechanisms associated with the clinical response.||Preliminary evidence for the efficacy of folinic acid is two-fold: First, several independent studies have demonstrated that a folinic acid intervention improves ASD core symptoms in ASD patients diagnosed with cerebral folate deficiency - a metabolic disorder in which the primary pathway for the transport of folate across the blood-brain barrier is dysfunctional. The primary transport pathway for folate across the blood-brain barrier uses the folate receptor α (FRα) and energy dependent endocytosis. A secondary pathway, the reduced folate carrier (RFC), can transport reduced forms of folate, such as folinic acid, across the blood-brain barrier. In case-series of children with ASD and cerebral folate deficiency, folinic acid (0.5 to 2 mg/kg/day) improved communication, social interaction, attention, and stereotypical behavior in some (3-6) and completely ameliorated ASD symptoms in others (6, 7).||The major cause of cerebral folate deficiency is an autoantibody that binds to the FRα and interferes with its ability to bind and transport folate. Recently, Frye et al. found that (a) autoantibodies to the FRα were present in approximately 75% of children with ASD, and (b) an intervention with folinic acid (2mg/kg/day; max 50mg) in children with ASD and FRα autoantibodies resulted in significant improvements in parental ratings of receptive and expressive language, verbal communication, stereotypic behavior, and attention as compared to parental rating for children that did not undergo any intervention (wait group) over a similar time period. This proposal will extend these preliminary findings by documenting response to a folinic acid intervention in a double-blind placebo-controlled manner and test whether FRα autoantibody titers predict response to a folinic acid intervention. If FRα autoantibody titers are found to predict response to the intervention, such titers could provide a biomarker to identify a subset of children with ASD that may benefit from a folinic acid intervention and may even predict the development of ASD symptoms in high risk siblings during the presymptomatic period.||Second, the ratio of reduced-to-oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) is an established measure of systemic redox status and oxidative stress that has been shown in three independent case-control studies to be significantly decreased in many ASD children. James et al. have shown in a 3 month open-label clinical trial that an intervention of folinic acid and methyl-B12 significantly improved GSH/GSSG and Vineland scores for expressive language, receptive language, and socialization in ASD children. Important unanswered questions are (a) whether this preliminary data can be confirmed in a larger double-blind placebo-controlled study, (b) whether redox status before the folinic acid intervention can predict response to intervention and (c) whether improved systemic redox status is associated with improvement in core ASD symptoms.||This study will assess whether a folinic acid intervention can improve both core symptoms of ASD (i.e., communication, socialization, stereotyped movements) and associated comorbid symptoms (i.e., attention) in a double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial. This study will address whether improvements in core ASD symptoms associated with the intervention are related to biomarkers of either (or both) biological mechanisms proposed to be influenced by the intervention (i.e., GSH/GSSG, FRα autoantibody titer). Thus, using these biomarkers, it may be possible that children with ASD who optimally respond to the folinic acid intervention can be readily identified early after diagnosis or even during the pre-symptomatic period.||This double blind, placebo-controlled (DBPC) study will evaluate the efficacy of Folinic Acid for the treatment of language impaired autism spectrum disorder patients aged 3-14 years. The study will consist of a single site trial with approximatley 48 entering the DBPC phase. Subjects will be male or female with current or prospective diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Language Impairments will be defined by the CELF, or PLS when warranted.||Phase 1 will consist of approximately 57children aged 3-14 with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (as defined by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule or the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised), until approximately 48 children with confirmed ASD are enrolled into a randomized control trial (RCT; Phase 2). Enrollment will continue as needed until approximately 43 complete Phase 2. Approximately 40 will enroll into phase 3.||Initial analyses will be undertaken to inspect data for errors, inconsistencies, and incomplete information. This will include examining the data with simple frequency tables and dot plots for univariate data and scatter plots and multi-way dot plots with bivariate and multivariate data. To summarize bivariate relationships among predictors and between predictors and outcomes, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient will be used. For reporting inferential statistics, regression coefficients along with the 95 percent confidence intervals will be used extensively to quantify degree of clinical importance.||The primary population will be the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population and is defined as all subjects who have completed at least one post treatment primary outcome measure. A secondary analysis will be performed on the ""as treated"" population defined as those subjects who had at least 75% compliance of prescribed medications and have not significantly deviated from the protocol.||To determine whether the folinic acid intervention over a 12-week period improves core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder in Phase 2, the procedure Proc Mixed in SAS will be used to fit a mixed model analysis of covariance. For the multisite study, the full model with the response variable language assessment will include predictors such as: intervention, time, autoantibody, intervention by time interaction, autoantibody by intervention interaction, redox status, redox status by time interaction, and baseline covariates. However, for the single site study, the number of variables in the model will be limited due to the smaller sample size and separate models will be performed on subgroups to compare the effects of the treatment in various subgroups. The results from the mixed model will determine if the biomarkers of physiological abnormalities, both autoantibodies and redox status, predict intervention response. Similar analysis will be performed for the secondary outcomes.","Inclusion Criteria||1.

Extensive research focused on the animal models of FXS show that targeted pharmacological agents can normalize synaptic connectivity and reverse cognitive and behavioral deficits. This translational work has led to multiple national and international controlled trials in humans with FXS now underway. However, in contrast to the heavy focus on medication treatments, there have been no controlled trials to empirically-validate cognitive or behavioral interventions for FXS. The proposed study, the first non-pharmacological controlled trial for FXS, will evaluate the efficacy of Cogmed, a cognitive training program proven to enhance working memory and executive/frontal function in a variety of clinical populations. Demonstration of effective Cogmed training for FXS would represent a major advance in the field, one that may also generalize to other forms of intellectual disability. Furthermore, it is critical to determine whether the targeted pharmacological treatments can accelerate learning and cognitive development.

Although the FDA has approved use of the antipsychotic drugs risperidone and aripiprazole for irritability associated with autistic disorder, a moderate response rate in pivotal clinical trials and concerns over tolerability and weight gain can force clinicians to select alternative drug treatments for which evidence-based support is sparse. BAART will assess predictors of efficacy, tolerability, and safety in 200 children 6-17 years old with autistic disorder (AD) during a double-blind, randomized 10 week treatment period with either risperidone or aripiprazole. Responders who complete the study may continue with medication treatment for three months. Factors considered will include 1) psychiatric history; 2) symptom response; 3) psychosocial support; 4) measures of tolerability; 5) serum prolactin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor concentration; and 5) a variety of single nucleotide polymorphisms related to target genes for drug disposition and transport, response, and tolerability.

What is yet unknown is precisely how imitation in children with ASD differs from that of typically developing peers.The investigators have identified a task parameter that separates preserved from impaired gesture imitation in ASD: children with ASD have difficulty imitating when the task requires two separate movement elements be coordinated simultaneously. By contrast, imitation is relatively preserved when movement elements are performed serially. The coordination of simultaneous movements is a hallmark of actions performed in the real world. With an eye to optimizing common therapies that depend heavily on imitation, the next step is to tease apart where, in the chain from perception to action, the capacity limitation in simultaneous processing lies. This study will be conducted in about two days and will involve imitating gestures that are presented via video. In addition, an EEG will record the brain's electrical activity during certain tasks to assess how the brain responds when the imitation task is more or less difficult.

These repetitive behaviours may considerably interfere with the child's daily functioning, learning, and social inclusion. As such, stereotypy generally has a negative impact on the child and family's health and quality of life. Several behavioural interventions have been developed to reduce engagement in stereotypy in children with autism spectrum disorders, but the limited number of specialists available, the long waiting lists associated with public health services in Canada, and the high costs of private services have considerably restricted accessibility. One potential solution to the limited availability and high costs of services is using a mobile application to recommend, teach, and monitor interventions designed to reduce engagement in stereotypy. To this end, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of the iSTIM (i.e., individualized Stereotypy Treatment Integrated Modules), a mobile application designed to assist parents in reducing stereotypy in children with autism spectrum disorders. Specifically, we will assess whether the iSTIM correctly estimates the frequency or duration of stereotypy, offers suggestions consistent with recommended clinical practices, effectively reduces engagement in stereotypy, and is socially acceptable, safe, and easy to use for parents of children with autism spectrum disorders. The results of the study will allow us to determine whether the mobile application may be used to treat this core symptom in children with autism spectrum disorders, which could potentially reduce waiting times and costs of providing health services to this population. By reducing engagement in stereotypy, the iSTIM may also promote and facilitate the social participation as well as improve the quality of life and health of children with autism spectrum disorders and their families.",Using Mobile Technology to Reduce Stereotypy,,,February 2019,Actual,"Child Development Disorders, Pervasive","Autism Spectrum Disorder|Child Development Disorders, Pervasive|Child Development Disorders|Stereotypy",,Single Group Assignment,None (Open Label),Treatment,,983,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Adult and adolescent patients, 14-50 years of age|Diagnosis of fragile X syndrome with a confirmed fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) full mutation and qualifying scores on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and CGI-S|Patients must agree to either remain completely abstinent or to use two effective contraceptive methods during and 3 weeks after the study||Exclusion Criteria:||Previous treatment with another metabotropic glutamate (mGLU) receptor antagonist within 18 months or with RO4917523|Participation in a clinical trial involving an investigational (unapproved) drug within 3 months or 5 times the half-life (whichever is longer) before start of this study|Any uncontrolled, unstable clinically significant psychiatric condition other than fragile X syndrome|History of suicidal behavior",185.0,Actual,All,No,,Placebo|RO4917523 0.5 mg|RO4917523 1.5 mg,placebo to RO4917523 orally once a day for 12 weeks|0.5 mg orally once a day for 12 weeks|1.5 mg orally once a day for 12 weeks,Placebo|RO4917523 0.5 mg|RO4917523 1.5 mg,Drug|Drug|Drug,"July 11, 2016",Estimate,"July 6, 2016",INDUSTRY,Hoffmann-La Roche,Phoenix|Long Beach|Sacramento|Aurora|Washington|Decatur|Chicago|Iowa City|Louisville|Baltimore|Worcester|New York|Staten Island|Durham|Cincinnati|Media|Nashville|Houston|San Antonio|Seattle|Bahia Blanca|Caba|Caba|Brampton|Sherbrooke|Santiago|Valparaiso|Bordeaux|Bron|Dijon|Marseille|Montpellier|Paris|Tours|Aguascalientes|Mexico|Lima|Lima|San Cugat del Valles|San Sebastian|Torremolinos|El Palmar.

Social impairments represent one of the most intractable features of autism, and evidence now suggests that OT biology is dysregulated in individuals with this disorder. The central aim of the research outlined here is to test whether OT administration to children with autism increases their quality and quantity of social interactions and enhances their ability to process emotional and social information. Findings from initial single-dose OT administration studies in teenaged and adult males with autism have shown improvement in some aspects of social functioning, but replication and extension to well-controlled treatment trials with younger male and female subjects is necessary to evaluate effectiveness. We therefore aim to investigate the effect of intranasal OT on social cognition and behavior immediately following a single-dose (24IU) and following a 4-week period of OT (24IU BID) administration in a sample of 50 subjects with autism aged 6 to 12 years. The primary outcome for this study is change in social behavior, as determined by parent ratings on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) after the 4-week treatment period. Secondary outcomes are changes in functioning on laboratory-based measures of social behavior and cognition following single-dose and 4-week OT administration. Research in a small study sample (N=13) also identified treatment responders and non-responders to a single-dose of OT. Thus, we also aim to identify biological and cognitive and behavioral variables (i.e., pretreatment levels of social functioning and pretreatment plasma hormone levels) that may influence treatment response efficacy in our larger study sample. On completion of the 4-week treatment period all subjects will have the option of participating in another 4-week double-blind trial in which they will be switched to the alternate nasal spray to that which they previously received. They will then undergo a fourth and final assessment time-point using the same testing procedures as outlined above on completion of the 4-week dosing. By providing subjects with the option of participating in a second 4-week treatment trial, all subjects will have an opportunity to receive the active oxytocin nasal spray. We also will be able to examine any ongoing effects of oxytocin treatment in the group receiving placebo during the second 4-week administration period. Subjects not willing to take part in the second trial will exit the study and will be referred to their treating physician.","Inclusion Criteria:||Medically healthy outpatients between 6 and 12 years of age (cut off 12 years and 11 months)|Intelligence Quotient > 40|Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder based on the Autism Diagnostic Interview - Revised, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, and DSM-IV criteria|Clinical Global Impression severity rating of 4 or higher|Care provider who can reliably bring subject to clinic visits, provide trustworthy ratings, and interacts with the subject on a regular basis|Stable medications for at least 4 weeks|No planned changes in psychosocial interventions during the trial|Willingness to provide blood samples.||Exclusion Criteria:||Diagnostics and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychotic disorder|Regular nasal obstruction or nosebleeds|Active medical problems: unstable seizures, significant physical illness (e.g., serious liver, renal, or cardiac pathology)|Sensitivity to preservatives (in particular E 216, E 218, and chlorobutanol hemihydrate)|A genetic abnormality (e.g., Fragile X Syndrome)|Significant hearing or vision impairments|Habitually drinks large volumes of water|Pregnancy, breastfeeding, or child birth within the last 6 months|Sexually active females not using a reliable method of contraception.",54.0,Actual,All,No,,Oxytocin nasal spray|Placebo nasal spray,24IU BID (3 x 0.1 mL [4IU] sprays per nostril twice daily for 4-weeks.|3 x 0.1 mL sprays per nostril twice daily for 4-weeks.,Oxytocin nasal spray|Placebo,Drug|Drug,"July 15, 2019",Actual,"July 12, 2019",OTHER,Stanford University,Stanford,United States,Stanford University School of Medicine,989,California,12 Years,6 Years,"Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo Controlled Trial of Intranasal Oxytocin Treatment for Social Deficits in Children With Autism.",Stanford University,Stanford University|Stanford University,Completed,Yes,Phase 2,May 2016,Actual,Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) raw scores measure social abilities with lower raw scores meaning better social abilities.

SPECIFIC AIM||To obtain pilot data regarding the safety, dosing, and efficacy of open-labeled aripiprazole in children, aged 12 to 18 years, diagnosed with autism. A larger, more controlled trial will be planned for this population if the drug is safe and tends to be efficacious.||II. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE||Autism is a serious disorder that first presents in childhood, usually before three years of age (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Though the incidence of autism is low (approximately 3-6 cases per 10,000 live births), the consequences of the disorder are severe. As the term ""pervasive"" implies, the symptoms affect most areas of functioning in the developing child, and the disabilities associated with the disorder tend to persist throughout life. Symptoms of autism include abnormalities in social relatedness including extreme withdrawal; communication including no or little speech; and a sameness or repetitiveness in behaviors and interests. Children diagnosed with autism can have severe problems including hyperactivity, lability of mood, irritability, withdrawal, and stereotypical behavior. Because of these severe problems, treatment of symptomatology often includes pharmacotherapy.||The most studied drug for treating children and adolescents with autism is the typical neuroleptic, haloperidol (Anderson et al, 1989; Anderson et al, 1984; Campbell et al, 1978; and Cohen et al, 1980). The main public health concern regarding the use of haloperidol is the risk of inducing dyskinesias (Campbell et al, 1988, 1997), though the dyskinesias have been reversible.||Evidence also suggests that atypical neuroleptics, such as olanzapine (Horrigan et al, 1997b; Malone et al, 2001; Potenza et al, 1999) and risperidone (Demb, 1996; Findling et al, 1997; Fisman and Steele, 1996; Hardan et al, 1996; Horrigan et al, 1997a; Malone et al, 1999b; McDougle et al, 1997; Nicholson et al, 1998; Perry et al, 1997) are effective. But the weight gain associated with these agents can be a considerable health risk (Pi-Sunyer, 1993; Sjostrom, 1992). For example, olanzapine use has reportedly been associated with increased blood glucose (Fertig et al, 1998; Gatta et al, 1999; Ober et al, 1999; Wirshing et al, 1998; Yazici et al, 1998). Ziprasidone is associated with increases in QTc, including in children (Malone, unpublished data).||Aripiprazole, a recently released atypical agent is likely to be as effective as other neuroleptics in autism, but may have the considerable health advantage of not causing weight gain. However, because there is a lack of safety and efficacy data with aripiprazole in children with autism, an open pilot study of aripiprazole in this population is indicated.||III. DESIGN AND METHODS||A. Setting: The setting for this study will be the Specialty Clinic for Pervasive Developmental Disorders, part of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic of Drexel University College of Medicine located at Friends Hospital.||B. Subjects: Subjects will be 15 children and adolescents who meet the DSM-IV Criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorder.||C. Design: This is a 6-week pilot study employing open treatment with aripiprazole. Subjects will be rated at baseline and thereafter assessed weekly.||D. Medication: Subjects will be treated openly with aripiprazole. Should untoward effects occur, the dosage of the medication will be reduced or the medication will be discontinued, as clinically appropriate. Subjects will not receive other concomitant psychotropic medication during the study. Medication will be taken concomitant with food.||Aripiprazole Dosing Strategy: Aripiprazole tablets (10, 15, 20, and 30 mg) will be employed for the study. The dosage range for aripiprazole will be 5 mg/day to 30 mg/day. Every effort will be made to reach and maintain a therapeutic dosage by week four of the treatment phase.||For subjects who weigh less than 25 kg, starting dosage will be 5 mg/every other day. After 3 days, the dosage can be increased to 5 mg. By week 2, subjects can be increased up to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 10 mg increments weekly.|For subjects who weigh greater than 25 kg, the starting dosage will be 5 mg/day. After three days, the dosage can be increased to 10 mg/day. By week two, subjects can be increased to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 10 mg increments weekly as needed.||Note: Should 5 mg tablets not be available, the dosing schedule will employ ½ of a 10 mg tablet and dosage increases will be made in 10 mg increments. We are starting at a 5 mg dosage to avert excessive sedation at onset of drug administration.||F. Measures||Primary efficacy measure: The Clinical Global Impressions (CGI; Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The efficacy of treatments can be judged on their ability to enhance global functioning, an assessment that is particularly relative in a pilot study. The CGI consists of three global scales measuring severity of illness, global improvement, and drug effect, and has been useful in measuring drug treatment effect in this population (see Campbell and Palij, 1985). The PI and another trained rater will complete this scale. Although only members of the research team generally complete this scale, it will additionally be completed by the subject's parent/caretaker. Having it completed by the parent/caretaker will take only minutes and may result in useful data. This measure will be completed weekly beginning at baseline.|Secondary efficacy measure: Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale (Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The CPRS was developed by the Psychopharmacology Branch of the NIMH to rate childhood psychopathology. Each of the items is rated from ""1"" (not present) to ""7"" (extremely severe). The first 28 items of this scale require no verbal response on the part of the subject, making them appropriate for rating children and adolescents with Pervasive Developmental Disorder. Of these 28 items, 14 are particularly relevant in autism (see Campbell and Palij, 1985): they assess the symptoms for which drug treatment is indicated including hyperactivity, aggression, self-abusive behavior, temper tantrums, lability of mood, irritability, social withdrawal, and stereotypies. A composite sum of these 14 items, the CPRS-14, will be constructed and employed as a secondary outcome measure, a procedure used by a number of investigators (Anderson et al, 1989; Campbell et al, 1986, 1989, 1993; Findling et al, 1997; Sanchez et al, 1996). We analyzed our data using the CPRS-14; the ICC was 0.8978. In addition, 4 factors derived from these 14 items will be examined. They include: autism, anger/uncooperativeness, hyperactivity, and speech deviance (Overall and Campbell, 1988). This measure will be completed at baseline and at the end of treatment.|Safety measures: (1) A physical exam will be completed at baseline. (2) Height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse will be obtained and recorded at baseline and at each visit during the study. (3) The following laboratory measures will be obtained at baseline and repeated at the end of the treatment phase: complete blood count with differential, liver functions, and electrocardiogram. Serum prolactin will be obtained at baseline and at the end of the treatment phase. Any other clinically appropriate tests and evaluations will also be completed whenever needed.||Untoward effects will be measured and recorded at each visit employing the following measures: (1) Dosage Record and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (DOTES); (2) Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale (TESS); (3) Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) (all from Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985); and (4) the Neurologic Rating Scale (Simpson and Angus, 1970). The DOTES and TESS measure a wide range of possible untoward effects. The AIMS measures dyskinesias. The Neurologic Rating Scale measures other forms of extrapyramidal effects that can occur with neuroleptics such as dystonias, parkinsonian effects, and akathisia.||G. Procedures: All patients appropriate to the study and their parent/caretakers will be approached and informed consent and assent (in subjects under 14 years) will be obtained. Subjects meeting the Inclusion Criteria, but not the Exclusion Criteria, will enter the baseline period of the study.||Baseline (week 0): Subjects will be rated at baseline employing the CGI and the CPRS.||End of Treatment (week 6): At the end of the treatment period, subjects will again be rated employing the CGI and the CPRS (selected items).||In addition, each subject will be rated on the CGI at each visit so that data from the last visit is available should the subject terminate the study prematurely. If it is known that a subject will terminate the study at a visit before week 6, the subject will be rated with the CGI and the CPRS at that visit.||All safety measures will be completed at each visit. Laboratory measures and EKG will be obtained in the morning.||H. Analysis: This is a pilot study whose purpose is to get initial safety and efficacy data with aripiprazole in children with autism. We will perform an ANOVA, repeated measures, for CGI severity scores, the CPRS-14 and the CPRS factors. Similar analyses will be performed for safety measures including for weight, prolactin and other laboratory measures, and EKG indices.","Inclusion Criteria:||Diagnosis of autism (DSM-IV) made by a boarded child and adolescent psychiatrist.|Males and females.|Aged 12 to 18 years.|Clinical judgment that medication treatment for autism is indicated.||Exclusion Criteria:||Major medical problems including cardiac, liver, endocrine, or renal diseases.|Uncontrolled seizures.|Baseline QTC greater than 425 msec.|Concomitant treatment with psychotropic medication.|History of prior exposure to aripiprazole.",11.0,Actual,All,No,No,1 Open Label,"Aripiprazole 5 mg to 30mg, individually titrated",Aripiprazole,Drug,"July 30, 2018",Actual,"July 27, 2018",OTHER,Drexel University College of Medicine,Philadelphia,United States,Drexel University College of Medicine at Friends Hospital,1008,Pennsylvania,18 Years,12 Years,Aripiprazole in Children With Autism: A Pilot Study,Drexel University,Drexel University College of Medicine,Completed,Yes,Phase 2,"November 16, 2011",Actual,,Clinical Global Impressions,Week 6,,Sponsor,,1008,,,,,,,February 2004,,July 2018,Child|Adult,"September 21, 2005",Estimate,"September 13, 2005","September 13, 2005",Interventional,"December 16, 2021",,No

A wide range of symptoms accompany autism, including self-injurious behavior, aggression, and severe tantrums. Despite an improved ability to reduce these symptoms, existing drug treatments continue to be associated with adverse side effects. Also, there is no existing drug treatment that reliably improves social behavior, a core deficit in autism. Studies on drug treatment combinations that are designed to reduce self-injurious behavior, aggression, and severe tantrums and improve social behavior in children with autism have yet to be conducted. This study will address the above-mentioned limitations by evaluating aripiprazole in reducing self-injurious behavior, aggression, and severe tantrums and by evaluating the addition of D-Cycloserine in improving social behavior among children with autism.||This study will include three phases and an add-on component for some children. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either aripiprazole or a placebo treatment for 8 weeks. Assessments measuring irritability, behavior, and social skills will be conducted at the end of this first phase. Those patients who respond well to aripiprazole will continue to receive aripiprazole treatment for another 16 weeks. This second phase will determine whether aripiprazole is associated with long-term maintenance of symptomatic improvement in patients who respond well to short-term treatment. Assessments will again be conducted at the end of this 16-week period. Those patients whose symptoms have stabilized and continue to improve while on aripiprazole will be asked to participate in the final phase of this study.

These children present a challenge to successful EEG execution, due to a lack of co-operation, and thus, are often in need of sedation. Historically we have used orally administered, Triclofos Sodium (TFS) - pharmacologically and physiologically similar to chloral hydrate, for sedation in this age group. However success using this drug is limited to approximately 75% in those aged 5 years and above, and possibly lower in this age group when associated with a diagnosis of ASD. The medication is often poorly tolerated by the oral route, and involves patient agitation, spiting (with incomplete drug ingestion), and immediate vomiting upon administration. Recently we have introduced Intra-nasal Dexmedetomidine (IN DEX), with an initial impression of much improved drug acceptance and possibly improved efficacy over TFS.||We designed this pilot study, with the aim of comparing efficacy, tolerance of drug administration and adverse events between TFS and IN DEX, with the goal of generating initial results as well as feasibility of recruitment for a larger trial.",Intranasal Dexmedetomidine vs Oral Triclofos Sodium for EEG in Children With Autism,,,"August 1, 2022",Anticipated,Autistic Disorder,Autistic Disorder,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Double,Supportive Care,Care Provider|Outcomes Assessor,1035,"Study participants will be allocated, amongst patients invited for routine EEG monitoring in the hospitals EEG facility.

Its presentation during childhood is similar to that seen in adulthood, except that children sometimes lack insight into the senselessness of the thoughts and behaviors. Although many patients benefit from treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a significant proportion have limited or no response to these medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may also be effective for OCD, alone or in combination with SSRIs, but there is a shortage of qualified therapists, and many patients and families cannot participate effectively in the therapy.||There is a pressing need, then, for the development of alternative, novel treatments for pediatric OCD. Neuropsychological and neuroimaging data suggest that OCD may arise from dysfunction of orbitofronto-striato-thalamocortical circuitry. Glutamate plays a crucial role in the regulation of excitatory activity within this circuit and may be involved in the etiopathogenesis of OCD. If so, then agents which reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission may provide unique antiobsessional benefits. Riluzole is a medication that reduces glutamatergic activity. A small open-label trial suggested that it might reduce OCD severity among children and adolescents.||The investigation will enroll up to 80 pediatric subjects with OCD including some who have both autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) and OCD. The subjects will participate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week trial of riluzole as a sole agent or as an augmentation to their currently inadequate therapy. Following the double-blind portion of the trial, subjects may receive three months of open-label treatment with riluzole, if it is clinically indicated.

Examination of whether changes in the activity of key pathways/proteins influenced by fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) (the mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) and MMP-9) are biomarkers of treatment responsiveness. Because lovastatin is also an anti-inflammatory, characterization of MEK/ERK signaling in peripheral immune cells both pre- and post- treatment will be carried out to determine whether levels of these signaling molecules are predictive biomarkers of treatment response. It is hypothesized that those individuals with elevated inflammatory cytokine profiles will be most responsive to lovastatin treatment. Once modeled in FXS, results from these studies can then be applied to other neurodevelopmental disorders including RASopathies.||The behavioral component of the proposed multi-modal treatment will be a Parent-implemented Intervention (PILI) that targets improvements in spoken language and challenging behavior for 10- to 17-year-olds with FXS by increasing parental verbal responsiveness (PVR) within picture-book based story-telling episodes.

Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) does not specifically allow for a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD with ASD, many children with an ASD manifest symptoms of ADHD and are treated for it with stimulants or other medication. The few studies on ADHD in ASD have not consistently established its cognitive and behavioral manifestations, or the optimal parameters for treatment. The proposed project will address these issues through studies of cognitive and behavioral functioning in children with ASD, with and without ADHD, and through a study of medication treatment of ADHD symptoms in autism.||Participants between the ages of 7 to 12 with an autism spectrum disorder participated in the initial phase of the study to examine the nature and effects of ADHD symptoms on behavioral and cognitive functioning. Participants underwent an initial psychological testing session that included standardized measures of intellectual, adaptive behavior, language, behavioral, and emotional functioning, along with standardized diagnostic measures to confirm their diagnoses of ASD and/or ADHD (Visit 1).

The central hypothesis of this project is that D-cycloserine will be efficacious in reducing certain symptoms of autism including some aspects of social impairment.||Autism is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder with a prevalence of at least 0.1 %. Despite investigations into the pharmacologic treatment of autism, no drugs have been shown to consistently improve the core symptoms of the disorder, namely social and communication impairment. Pilot data has suggested that D-cycloserine, a drug that affects the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor, has efficacy for the symptom of social withdrawal in autism. In this study, children with autism will be randomly assigned to treatment with either D-cycloserine or placebo for 8 weeks. Both the subjects and investigators will be blind to treatment assignment. Subjects will be rated on a variety of clinical measures to examine the effects of D-cycloserine on social withdrawal and other symptoms of autism. Safety data including side-effects, vital signs, blood tests, and electrocardiograms will be performed at the beginning and end of the study. This study will provide important information about the effects of D-cycloserine for treating core and associated symptoms of autism. It will also greatly expand the knowledge about glutamatergic agents in autism and provide crucial information regarding the pathophysiology and future design of drug studies in autism.","Inclusion Criteria:||Age 3 Years to 12 Years|Diagnostic Statistical Manual Version -IV (DSM-IV) and Autism Diagnostic Interview - Revised (ADI-R)-confirmed Diagnosis of Autistic Disorder|Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) Lethargy Subscale Score of 13 or greater||Exclusion Criteria:||Children with Severe to Profound Mental Retardation|Weight at Screening Visit <11 kilograms|Clinical Global Impressions-Severity Score of 7|Presence of a Neurodevelopmental Disorder with Possible Associations to Autism: Subjects with Fragile X Syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis, or other neurodevelopmental disorders known to be associated with autism or autistic features will be excluded.|Presence of a Psychiatric Disorder that would Require a Specific Type of Treatment: Subjects with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or a psychotic disorder will be excluded because treatment for these disorders often requires specific psychotropic agents.

Children with PDD may show multiple, serious symptoms including hyperactivity, inattention, impulsive and aggressive behavior, repetitive movements or speech patterns, sleep disorders, screaming, and self-injurious behavior. Drug studies to date have suggested that different behavioral symptoms of PDDs respond to neuroleptics, such as risperidone. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of risperidone (0.02 to 0.06 mg/kg/day) compared with placebo in the treatment of behavioral symptoms in children 5 to 12 years of age with Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD). Patients receive study medication (risperidone or placebo) to be taken orally once a day at gradually increasing doses up to a maximum of 0.06 mg/kg, adjusted at weekly intervals to achieve optimal effectiveness while minimizing any intolerance to the drug. Treatment continues at the optimal dose through Week 8. A parent or caregiver evaluates the child's behavior and symptoms at scheduled office visits during the course of treatment. The primary measure of effectiveness is the change in the Irritability Subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and other ABC subscales at end of treatment compared with baseline. Additional assessments of effectiveness include: the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (N-CBRF); the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), a measure of the patient's most disturbing symptom; and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) of the overall severity of the disorder. Safety assessments include the incidence of adverse events throughout the study; measurement of vital signs (pulse, temperature, blood pressure), body weight, and evaluation of the presence and severity of extrapyramidal symptoms by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) at specified intervals; clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis) before study initiation and at the end of treatment.

Seventy-five percent of children and adolescents with autistic disorder have irritability symptoms such as aggression towards others, deliberate self-injurious behavior, temper tantrums, and quickly changing moods. These symptoms affect their daily functioning such as school performance, interactions with family members and compliance to treatment. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic agent that has been recently approved for the treatment of irritability associated with Autistic Disorder in children and adolescents aged 5 to 16 years. The approved dose range is 0.5-3 mg per day. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness (change in level of irritability and related behaviors) of a lower dose (0.125 mg or 0.175 mg risperidone per day depending on body weight). The study will include three treatment groups. A placebo group, a low dose risperidone group and a higher dose risperidone group (1.25 mg or 1.75mg per day depending on body weight). This phase of the study will be 6 weeks. During the study, neither investigators nor the patients will be told which treatment the patient received. This is called ""double blind"". The placebo treatment is not expected to be effective. The higher dose group is expected to be effective. At the end of the study, data from the lower dose group will be compared to the placebo group to see if it is effective. Another aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of risperidone. At the end of the 6-week double-blind period, patients may enter a 6-month open-label period during which all patients will receive risperidone. During this phase of the study, the doses can be adjusted to a maximum of 1.25 mg or 1.75mg per day depending on body weight. Both investigator and the patient will know what dose the patient is taking. About 93 patients will be randomized. The study will be conducted by investigators from about 15 clinics. Assessments of effectiveness include the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) subscales including the irritability subscale (ABC-I), the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI C); the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S); the response rate, and the Compulsions Subscale of the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY BOCS). Safety evaluations include monitoring of adverse events, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, nighttime sleep quality and daytime drowsiness, and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) as assessed using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) and the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS). Venous blood samples will be collected for the determination of plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone. The study hypotheses are that the higher dose level of risperidone is significantly superior to placebo as measured by change from baseline on the ABC-I Subscale score at end point (Week 6 or early withdrawal) and that the lower dose level of risperidone is significantly superior to placebo as measured by change from baseline on the ABC-I Subscale score at end point (Week 6 or early withdrawal). Double-blind phase: Risperidone oral solutions taken once daily. Depending on body weight patients take 1.25 mL or 1.75 mL of either a 0.1 mg/mL or a 1.0 mg/mL risperidone solution or matching placebo, for 6 weeks. Open-label phase: Medication can be taken once or twice a day.

1131,131,1132,NCT00409747,,,Drug: Minocycline,Minocycline,Experimental,"There is a subgroup of children with autism that appears to develop typically for a period of time, and then loses social or language skills, or regresses. A recent study by Vargas and co-workers at Johns Hopkins has demonstrated that this regressive type of autism is associated with chronic brain inflammation as shown by an abnormal production of inflammatory cytokines among other abnormalities.||This present study will test the effectiveness of minocycline, an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties, in treating regressive autism. Although behavioral therapies have improved some symptoms of autism, there are no medical treatments for the disorder, and many children have ongoing behavioral difficulties. A medicine with anti-inflammatory properties may be beneficial for children with regressive autism.||This will be an open-label trial, meaning all children in this study will receive minocycline. They will also receive vitamin B6 to reduce the possible chance of side effects of the minocycline.||Children ages 3 to 12 with regressive autism may be eligible for this study. The children will take minocycline and vitamin B6 daily for 6 months. Prior to starting the medication and vitamin B6, children will receive a comprehensive diagnostic assessment for autism as well as a physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests. Children will then receive ongoing assessments to monitor their behavior, communication, language skills, and medical issues at 2 weeks, and at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 months. Children who respond to the treatment will receive an additional 3 months of minocycline and vitamin B6.",Minocycline to Treat Childhood Regressive Autism,,,April 2011,Actual,Autism|Minocycline|Regressive Autism,Autism,,Single Group Assignment,None (Open Label),Treatment,,1132,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that results in abnormalities of social and language development and is associated with rigid and repetitive behaviors. Although there is strong evidence of heritability, the involved genes have not been identified. The prevalence of autism spectrum disorders may be as common as 1 in 166. The average concordance rate in monozygotic twins is 70% suggesting that environmental factors play a role in the disease. Subgroups of autistic children seem unusually sensitive to infections, immunizations and dietary factors, but none of these factors has been causally identified with the disease. Nevertheless, autoimmunity has been considered to play a role on the basis of indirect evidence. There is no evidence-based efficacious treatment for autism.||There is a subgroup of children with autism that appear to develop typically for a period of time, and then lose skills, or regress. A recent study by Vargas and co-workers at Johns Hopkins has demonstrated that the regressive subtype of autism is associated with chronic brain neuroinflammation as exemplified by activation of microglia and astroglia and the abnormal production of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors assayed in both tissue samples (brain banks) and CS. The authors remarked that these responses were similar to those seen in some neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and that chronic microglia activation appears to be responsible for a sustained neuroinflammatory response that facilitates the production of multiple neurotoxic mediators. Chronic neuroglial activation could be the result of an abnormal persistence of a fetal development pattern. In this scenario neuroglial activation could play a role in initiating and in maintaining the pathology. Alternatively, neuroglial activation may only be a secondary response to the initiating causal factor(s) and not a direct effector of injury. Since neuroglial activation requires the nuclear translocation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-kappa B, and since inhibitors of NF-kappa-B with good CNS penetrance are available, the role of neuroinflammation in initiating and sustaining the autistic condition can be probed.||The antibiotic minocycline is a powerful inhibitor of microglial activation, apparently through blockade of NF-kappa-B nuclear translocation. Minocycline is neuroprotective in mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's disease and has been recently shown to stabilize the course of Huntington's disease in humans over a 2-year period.||To evaluate the possibility of benefit in autistic children, we propose to conduct an open-label trial of the anti-inflammatory antibiotic minocycline, an agent that reduces inflammation by blocking the nuclear translocation of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kappa-B. Minocycline is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for treatment of a variety of infections and has been widely used for the treatment of adolescent acne. Minocycline is currently in phase III trials for the treatment of Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.||This proposal is for an initial 6-month, single-arm, off label, open-label study (with a 3 month extension phase offered to responders) that will evaluate dose safety and efficacy of minocycline in 10 children, ages 3 to 12 years, with a primary diagnosis of autism and a history of developmental regression. The subjects will be evaluated by a diagnostic/behavioral assessment, and the extent of neuroinflammation judged by CSF cytokine/chemokine profiles before and after the 6-month treatment. Subjects will also be given 0.6 mg/kg vitamin B6 twice a day as a prophylactic for possible minocycline induced nausea and vomiting. If the results of this feasibility study are encouraging, we expect to conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of minocycline therapy.","INCLUSION CRITERIA:||The sample will be children with:||Diagnosis of idiopathic autism and regression|Age between 3 and 12 years|Willingness to undergo lumbar puncture for evaluation of proinflammatory CSF cytokines|Stable behavioral plus or minus medication therapies.||EXCLUSION CRITERIA:||Significant prematurity at birth (less than 32 weeks gestation); or birthweight significantly below normal for gestational age (SGA--small for gestational age).|Neurologic disorders including cerebral palsy, uncontrolled epilepsy, and Landau-Kleffner syndrome.|Evidence of renal insufficiency or hepatic disease (to reduce the incidence of side-effects, since minocycline is excreted by the kidneys following hepatic metabolism)|Increased risk of developing lupus-like syndrome with minocycline administration (positive anti-double stranded DNA or anti-nucleosome antibody tests at baseline, or presence of a first degree relative with S.L.E.)|Recent (less than two months prior to study entry) initiation of a behavioral therapy program or new psychotropic medication trial.|Subjects on one of the medications/supplements listed as those with possible interactions or those on high dose B6 supplementation.

Between 100 and 120 patients will be participating in this research study at five academic medical centers in the United States. The primary aim of the treatment is to reduce impairing behavioral symptoms such as aggression, explosive outbursts, or self-injurious behavior, without significant side effects. A secondary aim is to evaluate possible improvement in the level of social relatedness, attention, motor coordination, and short-term memory.||This study is a placebo-controlled, double-blind study (neither the investigators nor patients know if the treatment being given is risperidone or an inactive substance, placebo). Patients will be asked to participate for 6 to 8 months. For the first 8 weeks, patients will receive either risperidone or placebo, randomly chosen. At the end of the 8 weeks, those patients who have improved and were on risperidone will be asked to continue on this medication for another 4 months. The last two months of the study are again double-blind (neither patients nor investigators know treatment). Patients will either continue risperidone treatment or be gradually tapered from risperidone (placebo-substitution). This blinded discontinuation phase will last 2 months during which patients will be closely monitored for recurrence or worsening of symptoms. Patients who have been treated with placebo in the first 8 weeks of the study and have not improved will be treated with risperidone.

(2) Risperidone will result in more sedation (transient) and weight gain than placebo. (3) Patients continued on risperidone will be significantly less likely to experience exacerbation of symptoms of irritability, aggression, agitation, and stereotypy than those randomized to placebo, as measured by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), the Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Rating Scale, and the compulsions scale from the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS). (4) Patients continued on risperidone would show superior adjustment and functioning at the end of the trial, as evidenced by lower Clinical Global Impression ratings, when compared to patients randomized to placebo.||Design Phase I: Double-Blind Phase - Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups design.

The increase in the prevalence of autistic spectrum disorders from 4-5/10,000 in the 1980s to 30-60/10,000 in the last decade has raised great concern (Bertrand et al., 2001; DeStefano et al., 2004; Steinhausen et al., 1986; Yeargin-Allsopp et al., 2003). Research into potential therapeutic interventions designed to ameliorate the metabolic and clinical symptoms of autism is urgently needed to reduce the enormous public health burden of this disorder and to improve the quality of life for affected children and their families. Nutritional supplementation through subcutaneous injections of methyl B12 is a current treatment for children with autism that has anecdotal reports of remarkable clinical improvements and few side effects.

Research suggests that a dysregulation of the dopamine and serotonin systems contributes to these interfering behaviors in individuals with PDD. After benefits of typical neuroleptics were reported in subjects with PDD, research shifted to the atypical antipsychotics which have been shown to be better tolerated and effective in this population. However, the atypical antipsychotics have also been associated with adverse effects. Thus there remains a need for a novel pharmacotherapy that would be safe and effective for children and adolescents with PDDs. The primary objectives of this study are to determine whether aripiprazole is effective and well tolerated for irritability in children and adolescents with PDD not otherwise specified (NOS) during an 8-week acute phase and whether the effectiveness and tolerability of aripiprazole is maintained during a 16-week continuation phase.","Inclusion Criteria:||Male and female outpatients between the ages of 5 and 17 years and greater than or equal to 15 kg body weight.|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition, Text Revised (DSM-IV-TR) diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD NOS).|Psychotropic medication-free for at least 2 days prior to screening laboratory tests and electrocardiogram (ECG).|Significant irritability as determined by a Clinical Global Impression Severity score of greater or equal to 4 (Moderately ill) and a score of equal to or greater than 18 on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability Subscale.|Intelligence quotient (IQ) of equal to or greater than 50 based on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), 4th edition; the Leiter International Test of Intelligence-Revised will be used if a child is nonverbal but thought to have an IQ greater than or equal to 50.||Exclusion Criteria:||DSM-IV-TR diagnosis other than PDD NOS (autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, Rett's disorder, or childhood disintegrative disorder), schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or substance abuse within the last 6 months.|Comorbid disorder with possible association to autism (e.g., Fragile X Syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis).|A significant medical condition such as heart, liver, renal, or pulmonary disease, or a seizure disorder, as determined by history, physical examination, or laboratory testing.|Subjects with an active seizure disorder (history of febrile seizures in early childhood will be considered.|Females with a positive urine pregnancy test.|Evidence of a prior adequate trial of aripiprazole (defined as equal to or greater than 2 weeks at equal to or greater than 5 mg per day.

Effective early treatments that account for ADHD symptoms have not been developed for young children with ASD+ADHD. The overarching goals of this randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2, pilot study are to (1) evaluate a novel early intervention that pharmacologically addresses ADHD symptoms while providing an ASD-targeted behavioral intervention, and (2) identify changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie improved outcomes in children with comorbid ASD and ADHD ages 3-10 years. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether a stimulant treatment augments efficacy of an ASD specific form of parent child therapy based on the Early Start Denver Model called ESDM influenced Parent Coaching. Secondary aims are to determine the efficacy of combined intervention in improving ADHD symptoms and the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Adzenys-XR-ODT in young children with ASD+ADHD. The study will also examine correlations between behavioral changes and state-of-the-art eye-gaze tracking (EGT) and electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers to elucidate key ways in which ADHD impacts attentional and neural functioning in ASD+ADHD, and to potentially identify new targets for intervention in children with ASD+ADHD.

It is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of metformin (also known as Glumetza, Glucophage, Fortamet), a type 2 diabetes medication that can also improve obesity and excessive appetite.||Metformin has emerged as a candidate drug for the targeted treatment of FXS based on animal studies showing rescue of multiple phenotypes in the FXS model. Metformin may contribute to normalizing signaling pathways in FXS in the central nervous system, which may include activities of mTOR and PI3K, both of which have shown to be pathogenically overactive in FXS. In addition, metformin inhibits phosphodiesterase, which would lead to correction of cAMP levels, and MMP9 production, which is also elevated in FXS. Looking at the potential signaling pathways, metformin appears to be a good candidate for targeting several of the intracellular functions in neurons disrupted in FXS and, therefore, has potential to rescue several types of symptoms in individuals with FXS. The researchers have utilized metformin in the clinical treatment of over 20 individuals with FXS between the ages of 4 and 58 years and have found the medication to be well tolerated and to provide benefits not only in lowering weight gain and normalizing appetite but also in language and behavior. In this controlled trial, the researchers hope to further assess metformin's safety and benefits in the areas of language and cognition, eating and weight loss, and overall behavior.||Each participant will be involved in this trial for a period of 4 months.

Analysis will be performed utilizing the Sansone et al. (2012) FXS-normed ABC scoring measures.|The CGI is a clinician-rated scale utilizing history from the caregiver and incorporating it into a clinical rating, first for severity, and then for clinical follow-up. The CGI-S will be used at the baseline assessment to judge symptom severity as 1 = Normal, not at all ill; 2 = Borderline ill; 3 = Mildly ill; 4 = Moderately ill; 5 = Markedly ill; 6 = Severely ill; and 7 = Among the most extremely ill. The CGI-I will be used at the Week 8 and End of Treatment/Week 16 visits to judge the change in clinical impression as 1 = Very Much Improved; 2 = Much Improved; 3 = Minimally Improved; 4 = No Change; 5 = Minimally Worse; 6 = Much Worse; and 7 = Very Much Worse.|The VAS will be used to measure the severity of three specific behavioral symptoms targeted in this study: behavior problems, language abilities, and eating behavior. For each behavior the caregiver is instructed to mark their impression of the behavior at the baseline visit and again at the Week 8 and End of Treatment/Week 16 visits. The calculated distance in cm between the visit marks thereby demonstrates whether each behavior stayed the same, improved, or worsened during the study and by how much. The scale is from 0 cm (defined as ""worst behavior"") to 10 cm (""behavior not a problem"").|The VABS-III is a caregiver survey interview that measures the personal and social skills of individuals from birth through adulthood. It was designed to assess handicapped and non-handicapped persons in their personal and social functioning and is appropriate for individuals of all ages. The Adaptive Behavior Composite (ABC) score is calculated from the caregiver responses using age-adjusted scoring tables. ABC scores range from 20 to 160 and indicate low (20-70), moderately low (70-85), adequate (85-115), moderately high (115-130), or high (130-160) overall adaptive functioning.|The CSHQ consists of a series of questions relating to the sleep habits of children.

Its psychometric properties and clinical utility have been demonstrated in multiple studies since its introduction in 2001, and it has been found to be reliable and well validated with normative data from both parents and teachers. It will be completed by caregivers of all participants at baseline, Week 8, and End of Treatment/Week 16.|The PedsQL Parent Proxy consists of a series of questions relating to a child's quality of life and is administered to the caregiver of the participant. The parent proxy module designed for children 8-12 years of age will be administered to the caregivers of all participants, regardless of participant age, because the questions therein are most appropriate for the overall study population's cognitive age and ability. It will be completed at the baseline, Week 8, and End of Treatment/Week 16 visits. For any participants not in school, questions pertaining to ""school"" will be replaced with references to ""work"" or other activities in their life.|This is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group as a measure of health-related quality of life that can be used in a wide range of health conditions and treatments. The EQ-5D consists of a descriptive system and the EQ VAS. We will use the EQ-5D-Y, EQ-5D-Y parent proxy, EQ-5D-3L, and EQ-5D-3L parent proxy depending on the participants age and ability. The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. This can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the patient's own judgement. The scores on these five dimensions can be presented as a health profile or can be converted to a single summary index number (utility) reflecting preferability compared to other health profiles.|The CarerQol was designed to measure and value the impact of providing informal care on carers. It combines a subjective burden measure that provides a comprehensive description of the caregiving situation (CarerQol-7D) with a valuation of informal care in terms of well-being (CarerQol-VAS).|This is an online test developed in the Bolduc Laboratory done on a tablet at home. Participants are asked to remember association between sets of pictures. The test has been done in typical development and developmental delay for participants 4 years and up. The test has an online consent form followed by a short demonstration video. The participants are then shown pairs of pictures they must remember. Testing is performed right after the presentation and again 24 hours later. For the 24 hours testing, the participants/caregivers will receive an email reminder and will be invited to login to the Memory Game site to perform the association test this time without being shown the demonstration video. The testing takes about 20 minutes the first day and 7 minutes the second day. It will be completed before treatment starts and after treatment ends.|The CSHQ consists of a series of questions relating to the sleep habits of children. It will be completed by caregivers of all participants, regardless of participant age, at the baseline, Week 8, and End of Treatment/Week 16 visits.|This test involves recalling increasingly lengthy series of illustrated objects and activities around different themes (e.g., ""playing at the park,"" ""working on the farm"") that are presented in a particular order on the screen. Encoding, storage, and retrieval of episodic memories depend on a neural network including the temporal lobe (especially the hippocampus), the prefrontal cortex, and limbic/temporal association areas. Patients with FXS perform approximately two standard deviations below normal on PSM, which demonstrates good feasibility, test-retest reliability in both healthy children and those with ID; and moderate correlation with FSIQ.|Flanker is a measure of inhibition and visual attention. On each trial, a central directional target is flanked by similar stimuli on the left and right. The participant chooses the direction of the central stimulus. On congruent trials, the flankers face the same direction as the target. On incongruent trials, they face the opposite direction. Patients with FXS demonstrate profound deficits on Flanker, performing about 7 standard deviations below normal, and significantly worse than IQ-matched controls with Down syndrome. This test demonstrates excellent test-retest reliability and correlates significantly with FSIQ and dialing functioning in children and adolescents with ID.|This is a measure of cognitive flexibility. Two target pictures are presented that vary along two dimensions (i.e., shape and color). Participants are asked to match a series of bivalent test pictures (e.g., yellow balls and blue trucks) to the target pictures, first according to one dimension (e.g., color) and then, after a number of trials, according to the other dimension (e.g., shape). ""Switch"" trials are also employed, in which the participant must change the dimension being matched. It demonstrates good test-retest reliability and correlates well with FSIQ in children and adolescents with ID, including FXS .|This test requires immediate recall and sequencing of different visually and orally presented stimuli. Pictures of different foods and animals are displayed with accompanying audio recording and written text (e.g., ""elephant""), and the participant is asked to state the items in size order from smallest to largest, first within a single dimension (either animals or foods, called 1-List) and then on 2 dimensions (foods, then animals, called 2-List). The raw score is the number of items recalled and sequenced correctly.|This test measures speed of processing by asking participants to discern whether two side-by-side pictures are the same or not the same by touching ""yes"" or ""no"" (or a happy or frowning face for lower mental age). Participants' raw score is the number of items correct in a 90-second period. The items are designed to be simple to distinguish.|The participant is asked to read and pronounce letters and words as accurately as possible. The test administrator scores them as right or wrong. The items are administered by computer adaptive testing (CAT; continuously adapted depending on performance), and participant responses are scored by the examiner. For the youngest children, the initial items require identification of letters (as opposed to symbols) and identification of a specific letter in an array of 4 symbols. A theta score is calculated for this test.|This measure of receptive vocabulary is administered in a CAT format. The respondent is presented with an audio recording of a word and four photographs on the screen and is asked to select the picture that most closely matches the meaning of the word. A theta score is calculated for this test.|This test measures speed of processing by asking participants to discern whether four side-by-side pictures match the target image at the top of the screen. The items are presented one group at a time on the iPad screen, and the participant is given 119.999 seconds of actual presentation time (excluding transitions between items) to respond to as many items as possible (up to a maximum of 130). The items are designed to be simple so as to most purely measure processing speed. Speeded Matching gives a raw score, which is the number of items the participant correctly responds to (up to 130) in 119.999 seconds.|For individuals with FXS, we have demonstrated that the social gaze measure shows decreased visual fixations on the eye region while viewing human faces (with greater fixation to the nose region), and these individuals show abnormal pupillary dilation, an indication of sympathetic nervous system reactivity, compared with controls. While these measures do not appear to map directly onto caregiver-reported anxiety of the individuals level of anxiety, the results are consistent with high rates of social anxiety and sympathetic reactivity in FXS. Stimuli are presented on a Tobii T120 eye-tracker. The system has several benefits that make it conducive to testing individuals with developmental disorders. Stimuli consist of sixty colored photographs of adult human faces each showing a calm, happy, or fearful expression, and sixty scrambled versions of the face images.|Recently, researchers were able to obtain EEG recordings and ERP responses during an auditory oddball paradigm from patients with FXS enrolled in a controlled trial of minocycline. The study demonstrated the potential feasibility and sensitivity of ERPs as an indicator of cortical processing changes in a targeted treatment trial. It appears to provide a biomarker and measure for the human equivalent of cortical hyperexcitability. Additionally, we will administer a recently developed task looking at EEG habituation to pseudowords to assess word learning with EEG. Data is acquired using a Brainproducts Quickamp system. Raw data is imported into Brainvision Analyzer software for analysis. The continuous data is segmented according to the event type and filtered. We also analyze the EEG data at resting state for the oddball paradigm according to frequency distribution and the occurrence of spontaneous oscillations, and pseudoword habituation with ERP, energy and time-frequency analyses.|The Sensory Profile 2 family of assessments evaluates a child's sensory processing patterns in the context of everyday life. The forms are completed by caregivers, who are in the strongest position to observe the child's response to sensory interactions that occur throughout the day. The Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile was developed to assess sensory processing abilities in individuals beyond childhood. The Sensory Profile Adolescents/Adult is a self report, however, if the participant is unable to complete it themself, we will ask their caregiver to complete it and we will make note of who completed it. The French versions are the Profil sensoriel 2 and the Profil sensoriel-adolescent/adulte.","Change from baseline in the FXS-normed Aberrant Behavior Checklist - Community Edition (ABC-C)|Improvement of symptoms in FXS using the Clinical Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) scale|Change from baseline in the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)|Change from baseline in the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Third Edition (VABS-III) Adaptive Behavior Composite Score|Change from baseline in the Anxiety Depression and Mood Screen (ADAMS) overall score|Change from baseline in the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham Questionnaire (SNAP-IV) overall score|Change from baseline in the Pediatric Quality of Life Questionnaire (PedsQL) Parent Proxy overall score|Change from baseline in the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) overall score|Change from baseline in the Care Related Quality of Life (CarerQoL) overall score|Change from baseline in The Memory Game|Change from baseline in the Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) overall score|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox Picture Sequence Memory Test|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox Dimensional Change Card Sort Test|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox List Sorting Working Memory Test|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox Oral Reading Recognition Test|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox Picture Vocabulary Test|Change from baseline in the NIH Toolbox Speeded Matching Test|Change from baseline in Eye Tracking|Change from baseline in Event Related Potentials during the Auditory Oddball Paradigm and Pseudoword Paradigm|Change from baseline in the Sensory Profile-2 or Sensory Profile Adolescents/Adults","Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16","May 24, 2019",Actual,September 2021,Child|Adult,"March 5, 2019",Actual,"February 26, 2019","March 1, 2019",Interventional,"December 16, 2021",,Yes

However, the atypical antipsychotics have also been associated with adverse effects. Thus there remains a need for a novel pharmacotherapy that would be safe and effective for children and adolescents with PDD's including Asperger's disorder and PDD Not Otherwise Specified (PDD NOS).

Introduction||Lymphangioleiomyomatosis Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a disease of the lungs and lymphatics, which can occur sporadically or in association with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). The disease is rare, occurring in 1-2 / million of the population but in up to 40% of women with TSC LAM almost exclusively affects women, generally developing before the menopause. The disease is characterised by progressive pulmonary cystic change, recurrent pneumothorax, chylous pleural collections and, in most cases, progressive respiratory failure. Abdominal manifestations caused by obstruction and dilation of the axial lymphatics include lymphadenopathy, cystic lymphatic masses (lymphangioleiomyomas), chylous ascites and angiomyolipoma (a benign tumour). Survival in LAM is, 70 90% at 10 yrs, although this is highly variable since long-term survivors have been described. Diagnosis is made by a combination of clinical features and computed tomography scanning or, in cases of doubt, lung biopsy. In patients with rapidly progressive disease, hormone treatment (predominantly progesterone) has been used, although no firm evidence supports its use. Otherwise, treatment is aimed at complications including pneumothorax, chylous collections and extra-pulmonary manifestations. The only treatment for severe LAM is currently lung transplantation(Johnson 2006). Recently identification of abnormalities in the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) genes in sporadic and TSC associated LAM have identified dysregulation of the mTOR pathway in LAM (Carsillo, Astrinidis et al. 2000; Sato, Seyama et al. 2002) and have lead to clinical trials of mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin in LAM and TSC. At the time of writing these have not been reported but appear promising.||Background and preliminary data Cystic lung destruction is the hallmark of pulmonary LAM and generally results in respiratory failure over a variable period of time(Johnson 2006). Over-activity of proteases including elastase, trypsin and the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is responsible for parenchymal destruction in emphysema and other lung diseases. The MMPs are a family of zinc dependent proteolytic enzymes with proteolytic activities against extra-cellular matrix proteins. The MMPs are overexpressed in inflammatory and neoplastic diseases where in addition to processing extra-cellular matrix they also have roles in metastasis, angiogenesis, growth factor activation and inactivation(Stamenkovic 2003). MMPs -1, -2, and -9 are involved in the sequential digestion of collagen and gelatin and are strongly expressed in the walls of cysts where it is thought they contribute to parenchymal destruction in LAM(Matsui, Takeda et al. 2000). Further, MMPs can be detected by gelatin zymography in the urine of patients with LAM but not controls. Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic in common clinical use. In addition to its antimicrobial action it inhibits the synthesis and activity of several MMPs and inhibits proliferation of a range of cell types including arterial smooth muscle, cancer cells and cancer model systems(Bendeck, Conte et al. 2002; Duivenvoorden, Popovic et al. 2002; Onoda, Ono et al. 2004). In preliminary experiments we have demonstrated that primary LAM derived and angiomyolipoma cells produce MMP-2 and -7 and that MMP expression and proliferation in these cells in inhibited by doxycycline.||Preliminary clinical data of doxycycline in LAM In a preliminary open label study of doxycycline (50 - 100 mg qds) in 10 patients with LAM, doxycycline improved 6 minute walk distance) and Borg dyspnoea score (Glassberg et al. Data presented at the LAM Foundation International Research Conference, Cincinnati Ohio 2006). In a single case report, Moses et al. observed an improvement in FEV1 and oxygenation during exercise in a patient with LAM treated with 100mg doxycycline daily (Moses, Harper et al. 2006). In both of these cases MMP-2 and -9 were initially present in the patient's urine and was undetectable after treatment with doxycycline. In a study of 14 patients, doxycycline 100mg bd is known to give a mean plasma concentration of 4.41 µg/ml (range 1.9-9.4 µg/ml)(Prall, Longo et al. 2002).||Specific issues in orphan disease clinical trials and rationale for trial design Studying orphan diseases presents specific challenges, specifically the limited number of patients available, wide geographic distribution and low priority for funding due to the perceived poor economic benefit. Patients are well informed about potential developments due to patient groups and internet based information(Tattersfield and Glassberg 2006) and may obtain potential treatments 'off label' making definitive research studies impossible. As LAM is rare, cohorts drawn from a wide area are required for studies to achieve adequate power. We have 15 years experience of LAM research and from our UK LAM database estimate there are approximately 120 patients in the UK. We are currently performing an open label study of Sirolimus in LAM and tuberous sclerosis (TESSTAL, a Study of The Efficacy and Safety of Sirolimus (Rapamycin) Therapy for Renal Angiomyolipomas in Patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex And Sporadic Lymhangioleiomyomatosis). This included six patients with LAM whom we found to be well motivated and will travel long distances for study visits (including Cornwall, Kent and Perth). Despite the known adverse effects of rapamycin six of eight eligible (i.e. with LAM and angiomyolipoma) patients invited took part in the study. The current study protocol has been designed as a simple protocol which is both inclusive of most patients with LAM and has a follow up which is similar to routine clinical care which we hope will facilitate recruitment. In addition the protocol is less demanding than that of the TESSTAL study. As most patients are known to us via our database or clinical contacts we expect recruitment to be complete within six months.||Designing a definitive study is difficult without having an estimate of the likely size of effect, if this is large, as suggested by the one case report(Moses, Harper et al. 2006) a small number of patients are needed. If it is small as seems more likely a priori, a larger number of patients are needed requiring European collaboration and considerably greater funding. We therefore designed a pragmatic pilot study using a single geographic population with a simple, inexpensive protocol which will serve several functions, specifically to: (1) determine the optimum dose of doxycycline needed to suppress MMP production. (2) define the safety profile of doxycycline in LAM. (3) provide evidence of efficacy and size of effect. (4) provide data to help optimise the design and logistics of future trials.||2 Study aims/objectives||Hypothesis Doxycycline will prevent matrix metalloproteinase dependent tissue destruction in lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) thus preserving lung function, exercise capacity and quality of life.||We will perform a randomised placebo controlled trial of doxycycline on rate of decline of FEV1 over two years against matched placebo. This study will:||determine the optimum dose of doxycycline needed to suppress MMP production.|define the safety profile of doxycycline in LAM.|provide evidence for efficacy and size of effect.|provide data to help optimise the design and logistics of future trials.||With the data obtained we will be in a strong position to apply for European funding for a European wide trial should this still be required.||3 Investigational plan||Patient population and recruitment||Forty patients with either sporadic LAM or TSC-LAM will be recruited from the UK LAM database, physician referrals, LAM Action (a patients group for women with LAM) and the Tuberous Sclerosis Association. Patients will be contacted by mail by the principal investigator. Potential participants will receive a preliminary information sheet and response sheet for return by prepaid post. Those that express a potential interest in participating will be offered a face to face interview with one of the study doctors to assess eligibility, answer questions, obtain details of all physicians involved in their care and obtain written consent prior to enrolment. We anticipate recruitment will be complete within 12 months of starting the study.","Inclusion Criteria:||Sporadic LAM diagnosed either by cystic lung disease on HRCT classical of LAM plus angiomyolipoma or chylous effusion or cystic lung disease on HRCT and tissue biopsy showing LAM or angiomyolipoma|TSC-LAM diagnosed by cystic lung disease on HRCT and tuberous sclerosis diagnosed by TSC consensus criteria(13).|Patients with either an FEV1 below 80% predicted or evidence of a 20% deterioration in FEV1.||Hormone and bronchodilator treatment for LAM* is allowed providing treatment has not changed in the three months prior to enrollment.||progesterone, GnRh agonists and bronchodilators||Exclusion Criteria:||Inability to give informed consent.|Mental retardation.|Age less than 18 years.|Pneumothorax, chylous effusion, bleeding angiomyolipoma or change in hormone treatment within 3 months.|Previous organ transplantation.|Severe or uncontrolled epilepsy.|Use of any oral contraceptive pill.|Pregnancy or breast feeding.

However, there may be unknown risks associated with exposure to a new medication in a clinical population where this specific compound has not been studied extensively. The general and rare side effects are listed below. These risks will be minimized by careful monitoring and higher than standard of care safety evaluations. In addition, an individual's symptoms could potentially remain unchanged or worsen by initiating this medication, or from delaying initiation of a potentially more effective alternative treatment. For these reasons, participation in the study is entirely voluntary and consent may be withdrawn at any time without any repercussions and will result in the patient being immediately discontinued from the study. If at any time the clinician believes that the patient is not benefiting from the study, the study will be discontinued and endpoint measures will be obtained if possible.

Subjects are informed of the potential side effects and the importance of alerting study staff to the side effects in the consent and assent forms. Side effect data will be collected at baseline and every other week, but subjects are encouraged to give relevant information at every clinical evaluation.||Alternative treatments include no treatment with an attendant risk of increased weight gain, potentially leading to health hazard.

This study does not involve using any new medication, but to look into some of the side effects that children and adolescents may experience from taking an atypical antipsychotic. One of the side effects of some atypical antipsychotics is an increased level of ""prolactin"", a hormone that occurs naturally in the body which can lead to ""hyperprolactinemia"" a condition in which the pituitary gland produces too much prolactin. In order to further investigate these possible side effects, two groups of children and adolescents (aged 8 to 16) with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar mania, autistic disorder, or conduct and other disruptive behavior disorders who are or have been recently treated with an atypical antipsychotic will be enrolled; 1 group of children and adolescents will either be currently taking or have recently been treated with risperidone and the second group of children and adolescents will either be currently taking or have recently been treated with an a similar type of atypical antipsychotic therapy.

The patient's growth will be assessed using information on height and weight taken from the medical records at different time points before (up to one year previous) and since they started treatment with antipsychotic therapy. In addition, there will also be one visit to the clinic where the growth and stage of sexual maturity of the patient will be reviewed by both the study doctor and through the patient's own assessment, using a questionnaire and pictures developed specially to assess stages of physical development (so called - Tanner stage). In addition, one blood sample will be taken from each patient to check the levels of prolactin hormone in the blood to see if this differs between treatment groups. Potential patients will be identified through automated databases and/or medical chart review. If, after fully understanding the purpose of this study, the parent, legal guardian and their child agree to participate by signing an informed consent (children to sign an assent form), information (specified below) related to your child's treatment and development will be collected directly from central medical records or from notes kept by your child's doctor for evaluation. The following data will be collected from available medical records: information about the patient's use of antipsychotic drug and prescriptions; previous records of the patient's height, weight, and growth; physical and sexual development (so called, Tanner stage [developmental stage]) if available; results of previous blood tests taken to evaluate the level of the hormone prolactin if available; and, history of any side effects that could be related to increased levels of the hormone prolactin. All the above information will be collected within 1 year before the patient started antipsychotic therapy. The same information (if available) will also be collected following the time that the patient starting taking their atypical antipsychotic medication until the present time. As much information as possible will be collected for this period of time so that a determination of how taking antipsychotic drugs may have influenced the patient's growth can be made. The study doctor will see each patient for a single study visit. This visit will take place at a convenient time approximately one week after informed consent/assent has been obtained. At the clinic visit, the study doctor will do some examinations to check the patient's general health and assess their growth and physical development. These will include: a physical examination (including developmental stage assessment [Tanner stage]), weight and height, vital signs (pulse, respiration rate, temperature and blood pressure), medical history, and the collection of information regarding the occurrence of any side effects thought to be related to the use of atypical antipsychotic medication or related to the hormone prolactin. In addition to being assessed by the study doctor, the patient will be asked to complete the Tanner Stage questionnaire. This will involve the patient reviewing both pictures and written descriptions of children at different stages of physical development. The patient will have to decide which picture/description is most representative of their body. The study doctor will also look at the patient's current use of any other medications. Each patient will participate in the study for about one week. The outcome measures of the study will be to compare Z-scores for height, age at current Tanner stage, and prolactin-related adverse events between patients exposed to risperidone and patients exposed to other atypical antipsychotic drugs. Outcome measures will be collected during the study visit and retrospectively during the time of exposure for up to 2 years prior to the study visit.","Inclusion Criteria:||One or both parents (according to local regulations) or a guardian must have signed an informed consent document indicating that they understand the purpose of and procedures required for the study and are willing to participate in the study (If appropriate according to local regulations, the patient must also assent)|Treated for schizophrenia, bipolar mania, autistic disorder, or conduct and other disruptive behavior disorders|Had at least 6 months of exposure for an atypical antipsychotic drug within 24 months before the study visit (patients may or may not be taking the atypical antipsychotics at the time of actual enrollment, eligible patients can have exposure to multiple atypical antipsychotics, however, they cannot concomitantly be exposed to more than 1 atypical antipsychotic for a period of greater than 30 days)|Had medical records or automated data available for at least 1 year prior to the start of exposure|Height and weight were recorded at least once within 1 year before the start of exposure, and if available at any time points after the start of exposure in the medical records or electronic databases (not mandatory)||Exclusion Criteria:||Have at least 1 medical record, at any time before the start of exposure, consistent with malignancy (other than non-melanoma skin cancer), pregnancy, or a developmental delay or abnormality associated with growth or sexual maturation delays not related to the specified indications|Had exposure to prolactin elevating medications other than atypical antipsychotics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)|Had exposure to Paliperidone|Cannot comply with study procedures",244.0,Actual,All,No,,Risperidone|Other atypical antipsychotic drugs,As per local prescribing practices|As per local prescribing practices,Risperidone|Other atypical antipsychotic drugs,Drug|Drug,"November 27, 2012",Estimate,"October 26, 2012",INDUSTRY,"Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, L.L.C.",San Francisco|Aurora|Altamonte Springs|Gainesville|Smyrna|Naperville|Indianapolis|Valparaiso|Boston|Cambridge|Glen Oaks|Cleveland|Columbus|Antwerpen|Freiburg|Jena|Mannheim|München|Tübingen|Ulm|Würzburg|Athens|Nijmegen|Gdansk|Kielce|Lódź|Sosnowiec|Warszawa N/A|Warszawa,United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|Belgium|Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany|Greece|Netherlands|Poland|Poland|Poland|Poland|Poland|Poland,,1539,California|Colorado|Florida|Florida|Georgia|Illinois|Indiana|Indiana|Massachusetts|Massachusetts|New York|Ohio|Ohio,16 Years,8 Years,"Evaluation of Growth, Sexual Maturation, and Prolactin-Related Adverse Events in the Pediatric Population Exposed to Atypical Antipsychotic Drugs","Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, L.L.C.","Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, L.L.C.",Completed,No,Phase 4,July 2011,Actual,Height (cm) measured at the study visit was converted to a Z-score based on the US Center for Disease Control 2000 growth charts for US subjects and European growth charts for ex-US subjects.

The non-MRS arm of the study will include subjects 6-18 years of age, the bulk of which have completed the study as of the writing of this updated revision.||Subjects will first undergo a screening visit during which safety and diagnostic assessments are completed, and a minimum of 3 days will be allowed to evaluate the screening results. Then, the subjects will complete one or two practice sessions to provide training to achieve the necessary stillness for a duration that is sufficient to complete a MRS session. Upon completion of successful practice sessions, subjects will then be scheduled for a MRS visit. Once the MRS is successfully completed, subjects will be assigned to receive risperidone 0.25 mg at their baseline visit.||Response to risperidone will be measured at weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12 by the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). Additional secondary outcome measures are shown below (figure 1). A post-treatment MRS will be conducted after the Week 12 or early termination visit. Subjects will be given adequate medication supply to cover through the day of the final MRS visit.||Study Medication. Because Asperger's Disorder is diagnosed in childhood and is considered a childhood disease, our previous phase of the study focused on subjects ages 6 - 18. Published dosages of risperidone used in child, adolescent, and adult studies ranges from 0.25 to 11 mg per day. Most studies in children and adolescents begin with a starting dose of 0.25 mg bid, which is also appropriate for adults, and will be the starting dose planned for this study. The study progresses from a fixed to a titrated dose paradigm. After Week 6, dose will be increased (based on response and tolerability), ranging from one to two tablets twice daily (either 1 or 2 mg of risperidone daily). Again at Week 9, dose will be increased (based on response and tolerability), ranging from 1 mg to 4 mg per day of risperidone, one to four tablets twice a day of risperidone. Patients who have any trouble tolerating the starting dose may have their dose reduced to 0.25 mg per day and continue in the study. Patients who cannot tolerate the 0.25 mg dosage would discontinue the study in order to receive alternative treatment.||Schedule of Events and Observations||Screening Visit: A Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis (SCID) in conjunction with DSM-IV criteria and a psychiatric history, will allow the study physicians to establish and confirm a diagnosis of Asperger's disorder. Medical history, vital signs, clinical labs {chemistry, complete blood count (CBC), thyroid function, urinalysis, urine drug screen, and blood pregnancy test (fecund females only)}, a physical exam, and an EKG will be performed to determine patient safety.||Blood Draws: Additional lab samples will be collected at both screening and end of study to explore 1) the effects of diet on treatment outcomes with risperidone, and 2) effects of risperidone treatment on levels of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Nerve Growth Factor (NGF). The additional blood will amount to an approximate total of 8 tablespoons of blood collected during the study.||MRS Visits and Practice Sessions: Subjects enrolling in the MRS arm, will be scheduled for a pretreatment MRS which will take place after the screening visit but before the baseline visit and prior to starting risperidone. Subjects will also have a post-treatment MRS within 7 days of their week 12 visit or at study termination. Patients will be supplied with enough medication to continue treatment until the MRS measures are complete.||Subjects may be required, based on the investigator's discretion, to complete one or two sessions during the screening period for Practice Sessions for MRS studies to better prepare subjects for the level of stillness needed for MRS studies. The practice sessions will last approximately one hour and will be performed at the Medical College of Georgia (MCG) Office of Clinical Investigative Services, located at 1521 Pope Ave, Suite FF-100. Practice Sessions may also be performed at the MRI suite at MCG to allow the subject to see or lie in the MRI machine, depending on availability.||Rationale for practice sessions: We have learned that these sessions may be necessary to help subjects achieve the stillness required for MRS. During the sessions, subjects will be trained to remain still while lying on a padded stretcher, using behavioral and relaxation training techniques performed by a qualified investigator. Other efforts will be made to simulate the MRS environment that may include playing recorded sounds of a MRI machine and simulation of the padded head supports.||In most cases the Practice Sessions, would be all done prior to the MRS visit, but in some cases of a failed MRS visit, the investigator may choose to schedule another practice session prior to re-trying the MRS visit. The practice session will supplement the standard efforts used to support patients' compliance during MRI procedures. For example, part of the hospital's usual care during MRI studies includes the option of having the patient wear video goggles and headphones. Subjects in our study may view a calming video of neutral content to aid in problems affecting stillness.||Behavioral reinforcement and subject payments during practice sessions. Part of the payment for practice sessions will be used as a behavioral reinforcement plan, and this will be in addition to the $20 payment for clinic visits, reimbursement for travel over 25 miles one-way @ .28/mile, and $50 for the MRS visit (paid regardless of success or failure).||The additional subject payment in the practice session will be used as incentive and behavioral reinforcement for achieving stillness. Specifically, subjects will receive a token (such as a poker chip or printed paper token) worth $5.00 for each 5-minute period they remain still. If a subject's head moves during a period, they will be told they have to begin a new period. The achievement of stillness will be determined by the investigator at the time, taking into account the actual observed stillness and the need to encourage and reward the subjects' efforts.||The actual stillness practice will last up to 40 minutes, and the subject will receive a token for each 5 minute period they remain still, for up to 8 periods. The total additional payment for behavioral reinforcement will range from $5.00 to $40.00, to be paid in the same way as other subject payments. In the case of adolescent subjects, parents will be encouraged to consider the additional practice session payments to go to the child as a reward for the child's efforts.||Baseline Visit: Subjects will be scheduled for baseline procedures when lab results and MRS values are reviewed and approved by the study physician, in most cases expected to be a period of 7 days. This visit will consist of medical-psychiatric interviews and neurocognitive testing. A urine pregnancy test (done previously at screening) may be repeated at baseline based on the judgement of the investigator.","Inclusion Criteria:||Patients must be age 6 -18 for the Non-MRS arm of the study, and age 6 or above for the MRS arm of the study.|If applicable, a parent or legal guardian or legal representatives of study subject must provide informed consent and sign an informed consent document.|Female patients of childbearing age must be either postmenopausal for at least one year, surgically incapable of childbearing, or effectively practicing an acceptable method of contraception (oral or parenteral hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine device; barrier and spermicide.

They are also occasionally used for ADHD when more conventional treatments, such as psychostimulants and tricyclic antidepressants, have failed (Botteron & Geller, 1998). Despite a helpful role for the antipsychotic medications in many childhood conditions, there is a persistent although poorly substantiated impression that these medicines cause ""cognitive blunting"" in children. This may be more commonly heard than seen in print, but we believe that it is the cause of considerable resistance to antipsychotic treatment by physicians and nonmedical professionals alike.||At the same time, the data supporting the notion of cognitive blunting by antipsychotic medicines is largely negative (although limited in amount) and frequently badly out of date (see Ernst, Malone, Rowan, George, Gonzales, & Silva, 1998; Aman, 1984; Aman, Marks, Turbott, Wilsher, & Merry, 1991). There are good theoretical reasons to believe that novel antipsychotics may have no effects on cognition or may actually enhance cognitive functioning, at least in some disorders (Borison, 1996; Meltzer, 1995; Stip, 1996). At least one study thus far has shown significantly improved cognitive performance in schizophrenic patients taking risperidone as compared with such patients taking high-potency classical antipsychotics or no treatment (Gallhofer, Bauer, Lis, Krieger, & Gruppe, 1996).||Another source of resistance to the use of antipsychotic medicines with young people is the possibility that they may cause tardive dyskinesia. However, available data on the novel antipsychotics suggests that they are substantially safer than classical antipsychotics in this respect. Nevertheless, data are limited because of the newness of agents like risperidone.||Our laboratory at O.S.U. is unique because it has a sophisticated computer-controlled cognitive-motor test battery. O.S.U. is one of seven universities supported by NIMH as part of its network of Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology (""RUPPs""). Recently, Dr. Mike Aman reviewed the available cognitive test systems on behalf of the Autism RUPP Group. From this exercise, it became quite clear to us that we maintain what is probably the world's best system for assessing the cognitive-motor effects of psychotropic drugs in children, especially children with developmental handicaps.||The experimental (research) portion of the treatment is to assess the effects of risperidone (Risperdal) on learning performance and motor movements in children. This study is looking at whether or not risperidone improves performance on certain cognitive-motor tasks. It is also looking to detect any negative side effects that the medicine has on children's body movements. Risperidone is often used to treat children with disruptive behaviors. This study will involve 18-20 children who are being treated by their own physicians with risperidone (for duration of 4 months or longer) for such behavior problems.","Inclusion Criteria:||Aged 4 to 14 years, inclusive|Male or female gender|Reason for receiving risperidone must include severe conduct problems|Received risperidone treatment for at least 4 months|Dosage in the range of 0.01 to 0.099 mg/kg/day|Capable of discontinuing risperidone for up to 14 days in the judgement of child's physician|Taking co-therapy with psychostimulants, antihistamines, melatonin, and chloral hydrate is allowed as long as co-therapy is held constant|Taking co-therapy for sleep with guanfacine hydrochloride, clonidine hydrochloride, and trazodone hydrochloride is allowed so long as co-therapy is held constant|Must have a reliable adult carer who can report on subject's behavior and attend scheduled assessments|Parent or guardian must give informed consent, and subject must give assent if 14 years of age or older|Must be considered physically healthy on the basis of physical exam and medical history.||Exclusion Criteria:||Patients who meet DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, dissociative disorder, major depression, schizoaffective disorder, substance induced psychotic disorder|Subjects who are pregnant|Subjects with known seizure disorder|Subjects with a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome|Subjects with a known or suspected history of severe drug allergy or hypersensitivity|Subjects must have no significant medical disease|Subjects must not be taking any other psychotropic medications.",30.0,,All,No,,,,Risperdal,Drug,"June 23, 2016",Estimate,"June 21, 2016",OTHER,Ohio State University,Columbus,United States,Ohio State University Nisonger Center,1671,Ohio,14 Years,4 Years,Effects of Risperidone on Cognitive-Motor Performance and Motor Movements in Chronically Medicated Children,Ohio State University,The Ohio State University Nisonger Center,Completed,,Phase 3,,,,Short Term Recognition Memory task (accuracy)|Titrated Delayed Matching-to-Sample task (accuracy)|Continuous Performance task (omission errors)|Seat Activity|Graduated Holes task (errors and error times),,,Principal Investigator,,1671,,,,,,,May 1999,,June 2016,Child,"November 15, 2006",Estimate,"November 13, 2006","November 13, 2006",Interventional,"December 16, 2021",,No
