Growth hormone (GH) binds to its receptor and initiates a cascade of events which directly increases synthesis and release of IGF-1 levels. HYPOTHESIS: The study team hypothesize that rise in IGF-1 stimulated by growth hormone (GH) administration should produce improvement in behavior in children and adolescents with PMS as previously demonstrated with use of IGF-1.||RESEARCH PLAN: The study team seek to recruit 10 patients with PMS and administer growth hormone as once daily subcutaneous injections for 12 weeks at standard doses. The study team will monitor baseline anthropometric measures, laboratory parameters for growth, IGF-1 levels, and bone age prior to therapy and continue to monitor safety laboratory parameters during and after therapy. The goal of therapy would be to maintain IGF-1 levels between 1-2SD above the mean for age and puberty. Evaluations will include validated behavioral scales.

ASD affects as many as 1 in 90-150 children. Sleep issues/insomnia is very common in children with ASD (50-80%). Insomnia has a negative impact on both the developmental and behavioral function of the child and the quality of life for the family. Causes of insomnia in children with ASD are multifactorial and can be difficult to treat effectively. Low iron stores, as manifest by low serum ferritin levels, is also common in children with ASD. Both insomnia and low iron stores are associated with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and Periodic Limb Movement of Sleep (PLMS). Children with ASD often have difficulty communicating symptoms or tolerating Polysomnography (Sleep Study). This makes establishing a diagnosis of RLS or PLMS very difficult in children with ASD. Because polysomnography is not well tolerated in children with ASD and cannot measure sleep over time in a natural environment, improvements in sleep with treatment with iron will be measured by standard actigraphy (a watch that measures movements during sleep) and sleep diaries. The investigators also propose to evaluate periodic limb movement index (PLMI) as a predictor of response to iron treatment for insomnia in children with ASD, as measured by the PAM-RL, an actigraph designed to measure PLMS. The investigators will collect secondary data regarding attention and behavior over the course of the study to monitor improvement in daytime functioning in both groups. Many clinicians will empirically treat children with ASD, insomnia and low ferritin levels (< 50ng/ml) with iron. This is based on data from a previous open label trial demonstrating subjective improvement in restless sleep in children with ASD with low/low normal ferritin levels who were treated with iron. In order to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment, The investigators propose a randomized placebo-controlled trial of oral elemental iron for treatment of insomnia in children with ASD and ferritin levels that are low but above the laboratory cut off for deficiency. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of treatment of insomnia with oral ferrous sulfate (iron) at a dose of 3mg/kg divided twice per day for 3 months compared to placebo.","Inclusion Criteria:||Child has a clinical diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) criteria, confirmed by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule.|Age 2 years to 10 years 11 months.|Child has sleep onset latency of greater than 40 minutes on 3 or more nights per week, an average greater than 30 minutes per night, or night waking at least 3 times per week requiring parental intervention or lasting >20 minutes per night.|A mean sleep latency of 30 minutes or more, or night waking will be need to be confirmed by 7 days of scorable actigraphy data prior to randomization.|Ferritin between 17ng/ml and 49 ng/ml, confirmed at a central lab.|The child has been screened for medical conditions that affect sleep by their clinician and referred for subspecialty evaluation, as needed, for coexisting disorders (e.g., Gastrointestinal reflux disease, epilepsy).|We will include children with coexisting medical, psychiatric, and neurological disorders as long as they have been evaluated by a physician and a treatment plan has been implemented, with the child on a stable dose of medication for one month|Parents and their child are willing and able to provide informed consent (and assent, depending on child's age and cognitive function) and to cooperate with study procedures.

Thus, it is proposed that foods high in antioxidant activity can offer protection against oxidative stress and thus impact behaviors.",The Effect of High Antioxidant Cacao on Behaviors in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder,,,"April 1, 2018",Actual,Autism Spectrum Disorder,Autism|Autism Spectrum Disorder|Autism Spectrum Disorder,,Single Group Assignment,None (Open Label),Supportive Care,,208,"Outline of Research Plan The investigators will recruit 40 adolescents with ASD (age 13-17) to participate in an 8-week open label clinical trial of gabapentin, with wraparound neuroimaging to assess the primary outcome of Aim 1 (response of RAI GABA levels to 8 weeks of gabapentin treatment) and Aim 2 (evaluation of acute response to gabapentin as a predictor of response at 8 weeks). Clinical measures of social cognition described below will be obtained to address Aim 3 (to assess for clinically measurable improvements in social cognition deficits).||Clinical Assessments The subjects will be assessed with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) to confirm the diagnosis of ASD. The Ohio Autism Clinical Impressions Scale will assess overall severity of autism-specific symptoms. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID 7.0.2) will be used to document comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. The Weschler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence (WASI-2) will be used to assess IQ. Social cognition deficits will be assessed using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test (RMET), the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2), and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II (VABS-II) Socialization subdomain. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist, Community version (ABC), will be used to quantify behavioral measures associated with ASD. To assess whether clinical improvements with gabapentin extend beyond effects on social cognition, other symptom domains will be assessed pre- and post-treatment as well. Specifically, information on repetitive and/or compulsive behaviors will be obtained using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (CY-BOCS-PDD). The ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD RS-IV) will be used to assess ADHD symptoms, the Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS) to assess depressive symptoms and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, 2nd edition, (MASC-2) will be used to assess anxiety-related symptoms.||In addition to traditional outcome measures for social functioning in ASD, including parent report measures (SRS-2) and theory of mind tasks (RMET), a novel technique of measuring social motor coordination will be used that was developed as a potential outcome measure in ASD clinical trials. This assessment involves a video-based analysis of whole-body social motor coordination during a more naturalistic task, the conversation task of an ADOS-2 administration. Changes in social motor coordination will be evaluated in relation to changes in GABA levels with treatment over the course of the clinical trial.||Baseline MRI T1- and T2-weighted high-resolution structural imaging (T1- and T2-weighted (MPRAGE)) will be acquired, along with a baseline MRS using MEsher-Garwood Point REsolved Spectroscopy Sequence (MEGA-PRESS: TE: 68 ms, TR: 2 s) to quantify GABA in a 4 cm x 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm voxel localized in the RAI. Imaging sessions will be conducted at the Advanced MRI Center (AMRIC) at UMMS, which houses a 3.0 Tesla Philips Achieva MRI research scanner (Philips Healthcare, Best, Netherlands) and 8 element phase-array receiver SENSE head coil.||The baseline MRI protocol also leverages collaborations with the Human Connectome (HCP) and Adolescent Brain Cognitive Developments (ABCD) projects and is designed to support integration with national multi-site studies for added protocol utility. The scan session will include 1) a 3D T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo scan for cortical and subcortical segmentation (6.5 min); 2) a 3D T2-weighted variable flip angle fast spin echo scan for screening out white matter lesions and quantification of CSF (6 min); 3) a diffusion imaging scan, for segmentation of white matter tracts and measurement of diffusion parameters (1.5mm isotropic, b=1000; 110 directions acquired with both AP and PA phase encoding; 2 x 5 min); 4) a resting state fMRI scan (2mm isotropic ; TR 750 ms; AP, PA phase encoding; (2-5.75 min runs).||Acute Response of GABA levels A second MRS scan will be obtained two hours after an approximately 20 mg/kg challenge with gabapentin to obtain the acute response for Aim 2. Subjects will receive a single dose of gabapentin. The dose used will be calculated to provide the highest possible dose to the nearest 100 mg without exceeding 1500 mg or 20 mg/kg, whichever is lower. The weight exclusion criteria ensures that all subjects will receive at least 17 mg/kg dose. All subjects will be monitored for adverse effects for up to 4 hours following administration of the single dose and will have direct phone access to the principal investigator (24 hours/ 7 days a week) for reporting of any post-observation adverse effects. A blood sample to assess drug level will be taken as close to 3 hours after administration as possible, allowing time for imaging scan and transport to clinical trials unit for blood draw. This will be used to control for variability in bioavailability in interpreting the cortical GABA level changes.|Clinical Trial of Gabapentin The study involves an 8-week open-label clinical trial with gabapentin in 40 adolescents age 13-17 years who meet DSM-5 criteria for ASD. At the acute gabapentin dosing visit, baseline safety labs will be obtained, including complete blood count; comprehensive metabolic panel including electrolytes, renal function tests, and liver function tests; and creatine kinase. Baseline EKG will be obtained as well. The above labs will be repeated at week 4 and week 8 of the clinical trial, or if adverse events occur which indicate the need for testing.||At baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, and 8, the following clinical measures will be obtained: OACIS-S, OACIS-I (for post-baseline visits). At baseline and at 8 weeks, the following assessments will also be administered: VABS-II, SRS-2 (modified to ask about symptoms in previous 2 weeks), RMET, ABC, CY-BOCS-PDD, ADHD-RS-IV, MASC-2, and CDRS-R. ADOS-2 will also be re-administered at week 8 for videotape assessment of social motor coordination as described above. At week 8, a trough serum gabapentin level will be obtained to account for variability in bioavailability as a potential confounding factor. At week 8, the MRS scan will be repeated to evaluate RAI GABA levels, and also include a resting state functional MRI scan.","Inclusion Criteria:||Age 13-17 years|English as primary language (both child and legal guardian)|DSM-5 criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder|IQ >70 per Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI)|Informed assent for the study (The guardian must also give written informed consent)|For sexually active females, agreement to use two forms of contraception during trial to avoid pregnancy||Exclusion Criteria:||Any neurological disorder (e.g., cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome, cerebral neoplasm, bacterial meningitis, epilepsy, etc.)|Genetic disorders (e.g., Fragile X, Rett Syndrome, etc.)|Contraindications for MRI, such as metallic or electronic implants in the body, or severe claustrophobia|Unstable psychiatric disorder expected to require psychotropic medication changes over the course of the study|History of psychotic disorder|Any condition that would prevent the subject from being able to complete study protocol|Unstable medical illness such as diabetes, asthma, thyroid disease|Currently on medications that cause respiratory depression, e.g. opioids, benzodiazepines|Clinically significant suicidal ideation as assessed by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale|History of intolerance to gabapentin or pregabalin|Current substance use (including nicotine)|Current treatment with gabapentin|History of renal dysfunction|Subjects who weigh more than 88 kg|Pregnancy in female participants.",40.0,Anticipated,All,No,Yes,Gabapentin Open-label treatment,"8 weeks of gabapentin, titrated up to 20 mg/kg in 3 divided doses daily",Gabapentin,Drug,"October 8, 2021",Actual,"September 30, 2021",OTHER,David Cochran,Worcester,United States,University of Massachusetts Medical School,208,Massachusetts,17 Years,13 Years,Biomarker-Driven Pharmacological Treatment for Autism Spectrum Disorder,"University of Massachusetts, Worcester",UMass Medical School,Not yet recruiting,No,Phase 4,November 2023,Anticipated,Cortical GABA Levels in right anterior insula as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy,Right Anterior Insula GABA level,8 weeks,,Sponsor-Investigator,,208,Actual,"August 22, 2018","April 19, 2021",,,,"November 14, 2017",Actual,May 2021,Child|Adult,"June 22, 2017",Actual,"June 20, 2017","June 20, 2017",Interventional,"December 16, 2021",PI left institution.

Here, investigators are studying the effects of different doses of IN-OT on the modulation of behavioral outcomes and neural responses in a double blind crossover study in individuals with ASD.||The aims of the research are to:||Study the effects of IN-OT doses on the modulation of brain functional connectivity between key socio-emotional brain regions during resting state in ASD|Study the effects of IN-OT doses on the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activity of key emotional and perceptual brain networks in response to social cues (such as faces)|Study the effects of IN-OT on the BOLD activity of brain regions during an interactive social environment (ball game) in ASD||Investigators will compare the neuroimaging and behavioral results of individuals with ASD to control healthy males who will receive intranasal placebo. Investigators are also investigating the role of genetic factors, behavioral or clinical sub-groups of ASD, immune and environmental factors in modulating the effect of IN-OT on brain and behavior.||Participants with ASD will undergo 4 clinical visits during which they receive various randomly assigned doses of intranasal oxytocin and placebo. Both participants and the experimenter will be blind to the type of the treatment administered.||There will be only one visit for healthy controls who will all receive placebo spray. The visit for healthy controls will be conducted in a single-blind design. The experimenter will be aware that the subject is receiving placebo.

The Passport was adapted through a partnership between St. Michael's hospital and Autism Films Inc. into a mobile application called My Autism Passport (MAP). MAP allows families to learn about, and manage publicly-funded ASD services from their mobile device. Users can locate resources within their region, and track their progress in accessing services across multiple service agencies. The user can also set reminders on MAP which will be synced with their calendars, record notes, and read short summaries of the services offered by regional agencies. In this way, the application keeps families engaged, and allows them to take control of their child's care.||The feasibility of the MAP mobile application will be assessed by clinicians and end users.

Clinically, patients are normal before six months to one and half years old, and then develop progressive severe problems with communication, learning, co-ordination and neurodevelopment, with loss of motor skills around the age of two. At the same time, stereotyped hand movement typically appears. However, some of them will improve the abilities in speech and eye gaze, and the repetitive hand movements may decrease after few years.||Background / hypothesis：Preliminary evidence suggests that there are many differences in brain structure between Rett syndrome and normal people including cerebral volume reduction in both white matter and gray matter, cerebral blood flow in the frontal area, and density of receptors in basal ganglia. In MR imaging studies, decreases in parietal lobe gray matter were found, and several reductions in cortical white matter were observed by DTI. However, the visual related pathway- posterior corona radiata in Rett syndrome girls was normal to be increased in FA values. The similar result was also discovered in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, associated with speech, which equal to control subjects and patients with preserved speech (phrases and sentences).Despite this, few studies mentioned comparison with brain microstructure in the different stage, especially in adult patients. Therefore, our prospective study will be planned to figure out the specific changing pattern of brain structure in different stages of Rett syndrome. And the trajectory of microstructure in brain is going to be in accordance with the functional improvement.||The investigators suppose that (1)there are different microstructural changes for patients with/without preserved mobility, verbal ability and communication skill; (2)there are a few specific brain microstructures changes in visual pathway; (3) there is a specific changing pattern of brain microstructure in different aging of Rett syndrome. To acquire more specific results, the investigators aim to apply conventional MRI, diffusion-spectrum imaging, and some clinical assessment tools like Rett syndrome -related questionnaire, SSI, PDMS-2 and six-minute walk test to investigate their correlation.",The Findings of MR Imaging in Rett Syndrome,leeped@hotmail.com,"Wang Tso Lee, PhD",September 2017,Anticipated,Rett Syndrome,Syndrome|Rett Syndrome|Rett Syndrome,,,,,,334,"There is a clear unmet need for new therapeutics to treat irritability in children with ASD that do not have the metabolic and weight adverse event profiles of the currently approved treatments. Cannabidivarin (CBDV) is a nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid and a safe variant of Cannabidiol (CBD). It has no appreciable tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) [less than 0.01%], has been shown to have no impact on weight or metabolism, and improves both social and cognitive functioning in animal models of idiopathic and syndromal autism (Fragile X, Rett Syndrome, Angelman Syndrome). The CDC currently estimates 1 in 59 children have ASD. ASD is characterized by deficits in social communication, irritability, repetitive behaviors, impulsivity, temper tantrums, and high caregiver burden. Currently, the only FDA-approved medications for symptoms of ASD are aripiprazole and risperidone, both of which are indicated for irritability in pediatric ASD. These medications are effective but are associated with considerable side effects with long term treatment in this chronic developmental disorder, including weight gain, metabolic syndrome and the risk of type 2 diabetes, prolactin elevation and growth of breast tissue, extrapyramidal symptoms and the risk of tardive dyskinesia. The anticonvulsant divalproex sodium (valproate/VPA) also significantly reduces irritability and repetitive behaviors in individuals with ASD. Although VPA is efficacious for pediatric epilepsy and some symptoms of ASD, it also has significant side effects, including weight gain, sedation and nausea. CBDV, like VPA, is effective in the treatment of pediatric epilepsy, and ASD mouse models demonstrate potential mechanisms for treatment with CBDV, including potential therapeutic effects on repetitive behaviors, irritability, sociability, and quality of life, and the capacity to reduce inflammation. This study aims to examine the efficacy and safety of cannabidivarin (CBDV) with a primary aim of studying its effect on irritability in children with ASD.||STUDY DESIGN: This is a 12-week randomized, double-blind study of CBDV vs. placebo in 100 child and adolescent subjects aged 5 to 18 years with a diagnosis of ASD.","Inclusion Criteria||Male or Female pediatric outpatients aged between and including ages 5 to 18.

We made the observation today that research findings clearly in the field of autism and schizophrenic disorders that converge on common patterns neurocognitive abnormalities. Consequently, many programs support published today use the same therapeutic targets and the same tools in both pathologies. This raises two questions of science: (1) whether the disorders of social cognition reported in the field of autism and schizophrenia are ""specific deficit"" and not ""specific condition"", that is to say they are inherent social disadvantage whatever condition or (2) if these disorders of social cognition is a pattern common to autism and schizophrenia but are the result of specific neurocognitive mechanisms and different in each these pathologies. Systematic exploration of these issues is a current issue for understanding the pathophysiological borders between the two neurodevelopmental disorders but also to better define the potential targets of therapeutic strategies, psycho-educational and remediation of disorders of social cognition in autism and schizophrenia.||Main objective: To compare clinical cognitive profiles in adolescents with a schizophrenic disorder, autistic or healthy in the three areas of social cognition: perception of emotions, attribution of intentions to others (theory of mind) and style attribution.

Individuals with a disorder in the autism spectrum are a heterogeneous group of patients with early childhood onset of deficits in social interaction, communication and language, and repetitive and stereotypic behaviors. ASD has become increasingly prevalent during the last few decades (Wiznitzer, 2005).||The neuro-anatomical substrate of ASD has been the subject of intense investigation, but current findings are inconclusive, limited and sometimes even contradictory.||Medical treatment of autism is still a matter of dispute. Medications used are mainly aimed to treat the comorbid symptoms, such as epilepsy, tics, obsessive-compulsive or hyperactive behaviors (Wiznitzer, 2005). Although many efforts were invested in establishing a model of autistic pathophysiology, no such model is currently accepted, and there is no evidence for an efficient treatment of the core autistic symptoms (Wiznitzer, 2005).||Previous studies indicate that many brain systems are involved in the expression of autism. Specifically, it has been suggested that autism involves neurotransmitter dysregulations (Lam et al, 2006).

They may represent a measure of the excitatory-inhibitory imbalance posited to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Treatment of epilepsy is always indicated, but treatment of isolated epileptiform EEG (i.e. in the absence of clinical seizures) is frankly controversial. Since data suggest that these epileptiform discharges are associated with deficits in attention, language and behavior, the investigators believe that they may represent an important and novel treatment target in this population.

Cannabidiol (CBD), a compound originally derived from the cannabis plant but without the psychoactive effects found in cannabis, has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of children with severe epilepsy. Two non-controlled studies using CBD from local sources have demonstrated improvements in behavior in children with autism. Parents of autistic children have been using CBD products in an unregulated fashion with unknown dosing with anecdotal reports of improved behavior. This study will use EPIDIOLEX (EPX), a purified CBD oral solution that was FDA approved in June 2018 to treat severe forms of pediatric epilepsy. Study subjects will be 30 boys between 7 and 14 years of age with autism who have severe behavior problems. Every child will undergo baseline clinical evaluation, neuropsychological, behavioral, cognitive, and language testing, will have a test of brain wave activity (EEG) and a brain MRI scan. parents will complete questionnaires on various aspects of their child's behavior. Fifteen children will receive CBD for 8 weeks and 15 will receive a placebo that looks and tastes similar to the CBD (Period 1). All of the baseline tests and questionnaires will then be repeated. After a 4 week washout period, behavioral and cognitive tests and questionnaires will be repeated and then the treatments will be reversed (Period 2). At the end of 8 weeks, all of the baseline tests and questionnaires will be repeated. Study personnel and parents will be blinded to the treatment status of each child. Statistical analyses will be used to determine whether there are significant differences between baseline testing and results after placebo or CBD treatment. Types and severities of adverse events will be tracked to provide information about the safety and tolerability of CBD in this population.

Very early intervention, due to the presence of significant brain plasticity at these stages, may be particularly effective in changing these emerging trajectories, from a ""preventive intervention"" perspective that would aim to mitigate developmental risk and alter prodromal symptom trajectories, rather than eliminate a condition.||Our hypothesis is that the implementation of a specific therapeutic education program during a new pregnancy in the mother of a child with a diagnosis of ASD (MER Program) could improve the mother's well-being, increase parenting communication skills, and thereby improve interaction with the newborn at high risk for ASD.

The central goal of this project is to identify the mechanisms involved in the social-enhancing effect of dogs on children with ASD. The investigators will incorporate therapy dogs into an established evidence-based, group social skills instruction program for children with ASD, using a controlled experimental design with between- and within- subject comparisons and physiological and behavioral outcome measures. The investigators predict therapy dogs to have a specific and measurable effect on children's social behavior and that this effect is gained through identifiable mechanisms. Specifically, the investigators hypothesize that (1) an integration of therapy dogs into group social skills instruction will result in reduced stress and improved social behavior compare to traditional group instruction; (2) repeated exposure to the therapy dog across sessions will increase a child's preference for spending time with the dog and will increase the social-enhancing effects of the dog; and (3) that the therapists will experience less stress, engage in more social and affiliative behavior towards the children, and deliver higher quality instruction during sessions that include dogs. The investigators will enroll 72 children with ASD into group social skills instruction classes taught by 6 therapists. Each child will experience a 10-week, 8-student class in which either (a) the first 5 weeks will involve a therapy dog, (b) the last 5 weeks will involve the therapy dog, or (c) the class will not involve a therapy dog. The therapists will teach the courses repeatedly across the three cycles of the program with different children, rotating through each condition. Social behavior, stress behavior, heart rate, electrodermal activity, and salivary cortisol concentrations of children and therapists will be assessed and compared across conditions. The direction of the children's social behavior towards the dog and peers and the changes in quality of instruction of therapists during dog sessions compared to no-dog sessions will also be assessed.

ASDs are neurodevelopmental disorders that result in abnormalities of social and language development and are associated with rigid and repetitive behaviors. ASD prevalence may be as common as 1 in 110 and as many as 1/3 of these individuals have seizures. Abnormal electroencephalograms (EEGs) (without seizure activity) are even more prevalent (Spence & Schneider, 2009). In an ongoing study at the NIMH, approximately 50% of children without epilepsy had epileptiform discharges present on overnight EEG. The relationship between this abnormal activity and autism symptoms has not yet been studied; however, data from other epilepsy syndromes suggest that these epileptiform discharges contribute to behavioral and cognitive deficits. It is also unknown whether or not reduction of the epileptiform discharges will result in improved behavior and more rapid intellectual and social development in children with ASD. This pilot study is designed to address that question.||Study Population||100 children with ASDs including Autistic Disorder, Asperger's or PDD-NOS ages 3-10 will be screened to find up to 40 children with frequent epileptiform discharges noted on overnight EEG. Allowing for up to 20% drop out, we expect at least 32 to complete the study.||Design||The proposed investigation is a 9 month long trial with a 6 month double-blind placebo controlled trial of divalproex sodium (Depakote) and a 3 month open label extension phase. Prior to study entry, potential subjects will be evaluated with the standard PDN diagnostic/behavioral assessment (06-M-0065). Children meeting eligibility criteria will undergo an overnight EEG and those with frequent epileptiform discharges will be randomly assigned to receive divalproex sodium or placebo. Study drugs will be administered in a blinded fashion for 24 weeks with overnight EEG at 12 and 24 weeks. Biweekly then monthly visits with laboratory studies will monitor for behavioral improvement and for potential adverse effects. A 3 month open label extension phase follows.||Outcome Measures||The primary outcome measure will be EEG changes; tolerability and changes in behavioral symptoms will be exploratory secondary outcome assessments. It is hypothesized that divalproex will be superior to placebo in reducing epileptiform discharges on the EEG. In addition, exploratory analyses will investigate whether children who demonstrate improvements and even normalization of the EEG pattern will have more associated behavioral improvements than those for whom the EEG does not improve.","INCLUSION CRITERIA:||Have a diagnosis of Autistic Disorder, Asperger's syndrome, or Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS).|Are aged 3 to 10 years.|Weigh at least 12.5 kg.|Only children with frequent epileptiform EEG activity on the overnight EEG at NIH will be randomized to start study drug.

Various studies indicate that autistic disorder is subjected to a genetic predisposition, most likely polygenic and heterogeneous. However, no major gene responsible for this disorder has yet been identified. Given the link between the Fragile X syndrome (the most common form of mental retardation (MR) hereditary) and autistic behavior, it seems interesting to look, also, a possible link to the molecular level. Among the proteins interacting with FMRP (absent protein in fragile X patients), the investigators were interested to CYFIP1, protein encoded by the gene CYFIP1 appears to be a good candidate gene involved in the RM and autism by its chromosomal position and function. As FMR1, CYFIP1 is expressed in the brain cortex, hippocampus and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. This protein co-localizes and interacts with Rac and FMRP, which are both involved in neurogenesis and cognitive development. In humans, the gene encoding CYFIP1 is located in the 15q11-q13. Now, the only autosomal abnormalities most frequently observed in autism are those involving the proximal 15q region, including duplications or 15q11-q13 triplications interstitial, of maternal origin.||These data suggest that an / or more autism genes responsible are probably present in the 15q11-q13 chromosomal region, although no gene has yet been identified. Thus, the study of the role of CYFIP1 gene in patients with autism spectrum disorders would most likely contributory.||The investigators wish to study the involvement of the 15q11-q13 chromosomal region and CYFIP1 gene in autistic disorder in a hundred patients from the Autism Resource Centre (ARC) Nice PACA antenna, over a two year period.||The diagnosis and assessment report of children likely to be included in this study will be conducted at ARC Nice.

It is a double-blind control trial of sertraline (Zoloft), an anti-depressant typically used in the treatment of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and other conditions. The researchers are investigating the use of this selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in FXS because a retrospective study has shown significant improvements in language and decreases in autistic behavior. There is also emerging evidence regarding the stimulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the stimulation of neurogenesis when an SSRI is given early on in the development of animal models of Down syndrome. The researchers hope to see improvements in language stimulation, social gaze and social reciprocity, spatial attention, and a decrease in autistic behaviors.||The aim of this study is to carry out a double-blind placebo controlled trial of sertraline in children with FXS who are between the ages of 2 years and 5 years, 8 months old. At baseline, the researchers will assess behavioral and cognitive development. These children will be treated for six months with either sertraline or placebo.

Subjects will be chosen at random to receive either IGF-1 or placebo during the first treatment period and then switch to the alternate medication for the second treatment period. Therefore, by completion of the trial, all subjects will have received treatment with IGF-1 for 20 weeks. The study will be double-blinded; meaning, neither subjects' families nor study investigators will know who is receiving IGF-1 or placebo at any time. Treatment must be administered by the caregiver twice daily through subcutaneous (just underneath the skin) injections. Caregivers will be trained by research nurses in how to administer the medication. Participation in this study will last approximately eighteen months.||Throughout the course of the trial, investigators will collect information to assess the effects of IGF-1 and monitor for safety. Families must attend study visits at Boston Children's Hospital a total of seven times (including the screening visit) over the course of 18 months. These visits cannot be completed at any other hospital. Parents will fill out questionnaires and undergo a structured interview reporting on their child's health, behavior, and mood. Subjects will undergo clinical and physical examinations by a study doctor. Non-invasive devices and cameras will also be used to monitor things like breathing, hand movements, heart rate, and body temperature. Blood and urine will be collected for routine laboratory tests to monitor for safety. Investigators will also monitor safety by asking parents to complete a medication diary and side effect reporting form on a regular basis. Between trips to Boston Children's Hospital, parents will complete a set of online questionnaires and undergo a structured interview over the phone.||The cost of travel and lodging during research-related visits to and from the hospital will not be covered by the study. If a condition or illness is identified during the trial (and is determined to be unrelated to study treatments), referrals to outside medical care will be made. Study medications and all research-related materials and services will be provided at no cost to participants. Parking vouchers will be provided for all study-related hospital visits.||The study is investigating 5 potential effects:||IGF-1 may improve subjects' behavior, communication and/or mood. In order to measure this, investigators will evaluate subjects every 5 weeks throughout each treatment period with behavioral and psychological assessments. All of the tests used during these evaluations are non-invasive. Investigators will ask parents what their impressions are about their child's behavior and day-to-day activities through a structured parental interview and various questionnaires.|Investigators will examine subjects' brain function through use of a brain- monitoring device known as electroencephalography (EEG). The EEG measurements will be taken while investigators present subjects with exercises to stimulate their vision and hearing. EEG is a non-invasive way of recording the electrical activity of a subject's brain by applying a net of monitors (electrodes) to their scalp. Through this method investigators gain insight into how brain processes visual and auditory stimulus.|As one of the features of RTT is unstable vital signs, investigators are trying to determine if IGF-1 has any effect on normalizing subjects' heart rate and breathing patterns. To measure this, investigators will ask subjects to wear a non-invasive device that includes three electrocardiogram connectors and two stretchy bands that wrap around her chest and abdomen to measure heart rate and respiratory patterns.|The safety of IGF-1 in children with RTT is very important. Investigators will ask parents to complete a medication diary and side effect reporting form on a regular basis. In addition, laboratory tests will be performed every 10 weeks throughout each treatment period to evaluate the safety of IGF-1. These will be blood tests similar to those provided in typical clinical care. Subjects will undergo regular non-invasive comprehensive physical and neurological examinations, tonsil evaluation, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, scoliosis x-ray, bone age x-ray, ophthalmological exam, and measurements of height, weight and head circumference.|Children with RTT often experience unintended, stereotyped hand movements. The Qsensor® is a non-invasive device worn on a fabric bracelet that continually measures subjects' movement. Investigators will use the Qsensor® to determine whether or not IGF-1 affects the presentation of stereotyped hand movements.

ASD is being increasingly recognized as affecting a substantial amount of the pediatric population, with recent prevalence data showing 1 in 68 affected (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2010). Prior to the introduction of DSM-5, exclusion criteria precluded the diagnosis for ADHD when ASD was present (American Psychiatric Association 2013). Studies have shown that 41%-71% of children with ASD also meet criteria for ADHD, meaning up to 1% of the population may have comorbid ADHD and ASD (Goldstein & Schewbach 2004).||With the official recognition of comorbidity, treatment of comorbid ADHD when ASD is also present has been increasingly recognized as an important strategy in decreasing ADHD symptoms, and improving executive functioning and quality of life of those affected. Studies have indicated that some of the medications (methylphenidate, guanfacine XR and atomoxetine) commonly used to treat ADHD are effective and safe when used in comorbid ADHD and ASD (Ornstein & Kollins 2012; Ghuman et al. 2009; Handen et al. 2000; Quintana et al. 1995; Posey et al. 2004; Scahill et al. 2015; M. et al. 2012). While amphetamine class compounds are amongst the first line of treatment in ADHD, the lack of studies in this population has discouraged their use in subjects with comorbid ADHD and ASD.||The lack of safety and efficacy data is problematic as it limits therapeutic options for the population of subjects with ADHD and ASD. Amphetamines and methylphenidate medications are equally considered first line treatment options for ADHD (CADDRA 2011). Some subjects may preferentially respond to one group of medications over another, therefore it is important to have clear safety and efficacy data for both therapeutic options.||A retrospective chart review of this population indicates that treatment is started with methylphenidate versus combined amphetamine/dextroamfetamine at a ratio of 2.78:1 (Stigler et al. 2004). Due to the availability of evidence of efficacy in this comorbid population, clinicians may choose to skip to what is considered a second line medication for ADHD symptomatology rather than using LDX (or another amphetamine-based ADHD medication such as dexedrine or Adderall XR) that may have a larger effect size for treating these symptoms.||LDX has been shown to be an effective treatment for ADHD in subjects 6 and above. With long lasting effectiveness shown to last up to 14 hours, it could potentially improve ADHD symptoms and overall quality of life for children and adolescents with ADHD and ASD in home, school and after-school functioning.||The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LDX in treating ADHD when ASD is co-morbid.","Inclusion Criteria:||Male or female subject aged 6-12 years at the time of consent/assent.|Subjects parent(s) or legally authorized representative (LAR) must provide signature of informed consent, and there must be documentation of assent (if applicable) by the subject in accordance with the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guideline E6 (1996), any updates or revisions, and applicable regulations, before completing any study related procedures.|Subject and parent(s)/LAR are willing and able to comply with all of the requirements defined in the protocol.|Subject meets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-V) criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD combined presentation, inattentive presentation or hyperactive/impulsive presentation based on history and a minimum ADHD-RS score of 32 and a minimum CGI-S of 4 at baseline.|Subject meets DSM-V criteria for a diagnosis of ASD-level 1 based on history and Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS-2).|Subject has an SRS-2 total score of ≥ 70.|Subject has a Clinical Global Impressions - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score ≥ 4 at the baseline visit (visit 2)|Subject has a blood pressure measurement within 95th percentile for age, and sex (Appendix 1,1.1,2 & 2.2).

The lack of known molecular targets associated with AS has hampered the development of specific therapeutics. However, a recent surge of potential therapeutics for other disorders associated with cognitive disruption has begun to be used in human clinical trials. The molecular modes of action for many of these new therapeutic agents have correlates to counter the molecular defects observed in AS. One such agent is minocycline (MC), a drug traditionally used as an antibiotic. This compound administered to a mouse model of AS showed a significant decrease in motor deficit and an increase in long term potentiation.

ASD is defined by impairments in social-communication as well as the presence of restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. ASD is frequently associated with co-occurring language delays. Currently the only well-accepted treatment for core ASD symptoms is behavior therapy such as Applied Behavioral Analysis and Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention. There is no US Food and Drug Administration approved medical therapy that addresses core ASD symptoms or the pathophysiological processes that underlie ASD.||The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a liquid form of leucovorin calcium on social and communication impairments in very young children with ASD. Participants entered into the trial will have delayed language and moderate ASD symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that leucovorin calcium will significantly improve social communication as well as core and associated behavioral symptoms of ASD, and be well-tolerated with no significant adverse effects, in young children with ASD.||To assess whether the liquid form of leucovorin calcium is superior to placebo, the investigators will study 80 children across two sites, between the ages of 2.5 and 5 years, with confirmed ASD and known social and communication delays at baseline. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive active treatment or placebo for 12 weeks under double-blind conditions. At the end of 12 weeks, all participants will receive active treatment for 12 weeks. Language skills and social communication abilities will be measured at screening and after each treatment arm in order to determine if the supplement positively influences social communication. Additionally, the investigators will measure changes in neural pathways using either magnetoencephalography at Phoenix Children's Hospital or functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy at State University of New York, Downstate. While these measures will be considered exploratory, they will be important to begin to elucidate the neuronal mechanisms underlying leucovorin's impact.","Inclusion Criteria:||1.

These evaluations may take up to an hour to complete. In addition, subjects will be asked to participate in a psychiatric interview designed to determine the child's diagnosis and current problem areas. The subject's parent will also be asked to fill out psychiatric questionnaires. The interview and questionnaires may take up to 4 hours to complete.||Second, urine and blood samples will be needed for routine tests two times during this study (before any study related tests are done, and at the end of the study). Two teaspoons of blood will be drawn each time. The urine sample will be analyzed in order to assess kidney function and to screen for the presence of drugs (such as cocaine, marijuana, heroin, etc.). A positive drug screen would result in the inability of the child to participate in this study. Drug screen results will be kept confidential. In addition, an electrocardiogram will be performed to determine heartbeat.||Lastly, a pregnancy test will be conducted on the urine sample if the child is female and has reached puberty. The child should not be in this study if she is pregnant or a nursing mother. A positive urine pregnancy test would cause the child to be removed from the study. If the child is sexually active, she must be using an effective method of birth control during her participation in this study. Acceptable methods of birth control are oral contraceptive medications (the administration of which must be parentally supervised), IUD, depot medication and tubal ligation.||Subjects will be assigned by chance to receive either the active medication (Galantamine) or placebo (sugar pill) for 12 weeks, much like the flip of a coin. Neither the parent/child nor the investigator will know which of the two treatments the child is receiving.

During these visits the study psychiatrist will ask the parent for feedback on his/her child's condition and any changes that may be related to the medication, including possible side effects, such as nausea and headaches, and will check the child's condition. The psychiatrist will also record his/her weight.

A number of researchers have suggested that the neuropeptide oxytocin may be implicated in the etiology of autism.||Given the likely possibility of dysregulated oxytocin in autism, the goal of this pilot study is to investigate the long-term therapeutic effects of oxytocin in the treatment of autism. One practical issue with oxytocin is that it does not exist in a pill form. Only the intravenous form is available in the United States and this form may or may not pass the blood-brain barrier. In addition, intravenous oxytocin is not practical for treatment studies. One alternative is intranasal oxytocin; this form of administration is known to pass the blood-brain barrier, and it is easy for participants to self-administer. Although not available in the United States, we are in the process of receiving an Investigational New Drug exemption for its use and can import it from Europe.||Thus, this pilot investigation will explore daily intranasal oxytocin in the treatment of autism. Also, there are very few, if any, outcome measures to assess social functioning in the ""real world"" in the context of clinical trials; yet, this is a major target for intervention, especially in autism. Thus, a final goal of this study will be to explore the use of Event Contingent Recording to index changes in social functioning and affect. Event Contingent Recording is a methodology developed by personality/social psychologists, which allows participants to report on symptoms, affect, and behavior close in time to experience. In addition, to enabling more sensitive assessments, this methodology allows for the assessment of more diverse (e.g., at home versus work) and more detailed measurements of mood and behavior.||Finally, a portion of this study aims to perform gene expression profiling using fresh whole blood to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying oxytocin therapy and oxytocin efficacy in adults with high functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome. The systemic effects of oxytocin therapy and the molecular basis for a positive treatment response to oxytocin are not well understood. An understanding of the former may help predict those persons who may suffer side-effects from treatment and the latter may help provide easily accessible peripheral biomarkers that could predict treatment response.","Inclusion Criteria:||Male or female outpatients 18 to 60 years of age.|Meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision.

The present study will employ an ABA design in which three pediatric participants will be selected to receive baseline medical, developmental, behavioral, and cognitive evaluations, followed by a 26 week administration of sirolimus, repeated baseline assessments at the end of the 26 week treatment phase, and a 4 week titrated withdrawal followed by a 22 week period in which no rapalogue is administered. All participants will again be administered baseline medical, behavioral, and cognitive evaluations at the end of the study in order to compare all evaluations done at baseline, the end of the 26 week treatment, and completion of the study. These comparisons will be done to assess secondary outcomes that include reductions in autistic symptoms, self-injury, and aggression, as well as improvements in cognitive function across multiple domains. Furthermore, administration of the secondary outcome measures will also allow us to better understand the sensitivity of these measures in patients with TSC during the course of a clinical trial.||Families of potentially eligible children who express interest in the study and meet prescreening criteria will be invited to attend a screening visit to determine eligibility, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and availability for eight additional study visits.

There is no described human neuroserpin deficiency phenotype. The neuroserpin knockout mouse phenotype also suggests a possible overlap with autism. Neuroserpin could contribute directly at the synapse or through altered neuron migration during early development leading to the ""underconnectivity"" that underlies autism by potentially contributing to the excess of short connections and not enough long ones seen in autistic brains, possibly due to an imbalance in pruning of neurons and synapses early in life.

This widespread use reflects the hypothesis that many cases of ASD are caused by exposure to thimerosal, an ethylmercury-based compound used previously in the US as a vaccine preservative for routine childhood immunizations. The prevalent use of chelation therapy stands in stark contrast with the lack of scientific or clinical evidence of efficacy, and creates a public health imperative for empiric data. Thus we propose a controlled trial of the effects of chelation on the core behavioral symptoms and overall functioning of children with ASD. The present investigation is a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study of the oral chelating agent meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA; succimer) among 120 children, ages four to ten years, who meet criteria for ASD. Pre- and post-treatment behavioral ratings will be used to evaluate the efficacy of chelation. In addition, children will undergo comprehensive medical history, physical examination and laboratory analyses.||Our objective is to quantify differences in behavioral functioning between the chelation treatment group and the placebo control group. Analysis of mercury levels before and during the course of treatment will be used to confirm the expected DMSA-induced excretion of mercury and to identify differences among children in the extent of excretion.

Due to the lack of known treatments for autism, many parents seek complementary and alternative medical (CAM) therapies hoping to help their affected child. Methylcobalamin (methyl B12) is a commonly used CAM treatment that has anecdotal reports of remarkable clinical improvements with few side effects. Prior studies have found that children with autism have deficiencies in key metabolites and antioxidants which can be caused by methyl B12 deficiency; additional studies have shown that methyl B12 normalizes deficiencies in these metabolites and antioxidants. Based on these reports, a pilot study was conducted at UC Davis on the effect of methyl B12 on the behavioral and metabolic measures in children with autism. The preliminary results of 29 subjects revealed a subgroup of 9 responders to clinical behavior assessments. These responders also demonstrated significant improvement on the plasma measures of antioxidant capacity, suggesting methyl B12 improves symptoms in a subgroup of children with autism by increasing key antioxidants. The current study will have an 8 week double blind design with 50 subjects, designed to evaluate improvements from methyl B12 by using behavioral assessments and analysis of specific metabolites in the subjects' blood. This study will determine whether methyl B12 will lead to benefits in any of the core features of autism, and will examine metabolic changes with the hope of potentially identifying a biomarker for treatment response in a subgroup of subjects.","Inclusion Criteria:||Diagnosis of DSM IV defined autism and meets cut off on Autism Diagnostic Inventory-Revised (ADI-R) and/or the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS)|Age 3 through 7 years|IQ of 50 or above|Parental agreement to continue present dietary, behavioral or psychotropic drug treatment but not change treatment during 8 week intervention|Willingness to have blood drawn, without the use of a sedative prescription from the study doctor||Exclusion Criteria:||Bleeding disorder|Cancer|Seizure disorder|Fragile X or other known genetic cause of autism|Perinatal brain injury (i.e.: cerebral palsy)|Other serious medical illnesses|Current use of any B12 supplement",57.0,Actual,All,No,,Active|Placebo,75 µg/Kg subcutaneously injected once every 3 days|placebo,Methyl B12|Placebo,Drug|Dietary Supplement,"February 24, 2017",Actual,"January 4, 2017",OTHER,"University of California, San Francisco",San Francisco,United States,UCSF,779,California,7 Years,3 Years,Double Blind Placebo Controlled Trial of Methyl B12 on Behavioral and Metabolic Measures in Children With Autism,"University of California, San Francisco","University of California, San Francisco",Completed,No,Phase 2|Phase 3,October 2013,Actual,"PI assesses subject's change using the CGI-I measure.

Knowing that occupational therapy (OT) services designed to address the post-secondary transition needs of this population have been largely unexplored, and recognizing the need for OT students to gain practical experience facilitating psychosocial groups, this study seeks to: (1) evaluate program impacts on participants' psychosocial functioning and work readiness, and (2) pilot the use of OT students as group facilitators. The study will follow a mixed-methods, single group design, using questionnaires and interviews to assess skills, confidence, and psychological wellness before intervention, immediately after, and at follow-up. OT students will also be interviewed and complete pre- and post-intervention assessments of clinical self-efficacy and stress.

Melatonin produced in the pineal gland helps regulate human circadian rhythms including sleep-wake, and is considered as the best measure of circadian rhythms.||Several studies revealed that plasmatic and urinary nocturnal levels of melatonin are significantly lower in individuals with autism (in particular, in prepubertal children) compared to typically developing individuals. In addition, this reduction in nocturnal melatonin was significantly associated with the severity of communication and social interaction impairments, especially in verbal communication and play. Finally, diurnal excretion of melatonin was also found to be decreased in individuals with autistic disorder.||Given these results, administration of melatonin could serve, at least in prepubertal children wih autism, to normalize physiological, developmental and behavioral processes that are influenced by this pineal hormone. A randomized clinical trial is therefore necessary to establish potential therapeutic efficacy of melatonin in autistic disorder and to specify its dose-effect relation. This is the first clinical trial studying the melatonin dose-effect in autism.","Inclusion Criteria:||Prepubertal males with autism from 6 to 8 years old, according to the diagnostic criteria of autistic disorder of the WHO (CIM-10), American (DSM-IV-TR) and French (CFTMEA) classifications.|Verbal language level required for the ADOS (Module 1) (i.e., no verbal language as defined by the ADI-R (autism diagnostic interview-revised) scale).|Written informed consent of the parents or the legal representative.||Non-inclusion Criteria:||Treatment by benzodiazepines.|Treatment by anticonvulsant drugs.|Treatment by serotoninergic products.|Hypersensitivity reaction to the active substance or one of the excipients of the product.|Patient with hereditary galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or malabsorption syndrome of glucose and galactose.|Children who are not able to swallow tablets.",34.0,Actual,Male,No,,10 mg melatonin|2 mg melatonin|4 mg melatonin|2 mg melatonin|4 mg melatonin|Placebo,Placebo tablets of Circadin®,melatonin|Placebo,Drug|Drug,"September 5, 2013",Estimate,"September 4, 2013",OTHER,Rennes University Hospital,Paris|Poitiers|Reims|Rennes,France|France|France|France,Service de Psychiatrie de l'Enfant et de l'Adolescent - Hôpital de la Pitié-Salpêtrière|Centre Hospitalier Spécialisé Henri Laborit|Service de Psychothérapie de l'Enfant et de l'Adolescent - Hôpital Robert Debré|Pôle de Psychiatrie de l'Enfant et de l'Adolescent - Centre Hospitalier Guillaume Régnier,833,,8 Years,6 Years,Melatonin Dose-effect Relation in Childhood Autism,Rennes University Hospital,"Centre Hospitalier Guillaume Régnier, RENNES|Rennes University Hospital",Completed,Yes,Phase 2,July 2013,Actual,,Severity of autistic disorder,6 weeks after the beginning of the treatment.,,Sponsor,,833,,,,,,,"January 23, 2011",Actual,"September 27, 2021",Child|Adult|Older Adult,"May 28, 2010",Estimate,"May 27, 2010","May 27, 2010",Observational,"December 16, 2021",,No

The core symptoms of ASD are deficits in social communication and the presence of repetitive and restricted behaviours and interests, including sensory anomalies. Currently, there are no effective medical treatments for the core symptoms of ASD, and families frequently use costly non evidence based interventions. Developing drugs for ASD has been challenging because of a limited understanding of its underlying pathophysiology(ies), and difficulties modelling it in vitro and in vivo.||A recent study from EU-AIMS reported, for the first time in ASD, that differences in E-I balance can be 'shifted' using a GABA acting drug (riluzole), and that abnormalities in functional connectivity can be 'normalised' by targeting E-I, even in adults. This offers promise that drugs targeting specific parts of the GABA pathway may improve symptoms.||The aim of the investigator's project is to conduct a double-blind Randomized Control Trial (RCT) focused on GABA/glutamate equilibrium, to assess the efficacy of a drug that targets core and/or comorbid symptoms in ASD. Arbaclofen is a selective GABA-B receptor agonist and augments GABA-ergic activity, inhibits presynaptic release of glutamate, inhibits postsynaptic transmission, and modulates intracellular signalling. Through elevation of GABA-ergic inhibitory activity, Arbaclofen may act to alleviate ASD symptoms with social anxiety and emotional hyperarousal.||Hypothesis: Arbaclofen will be superior to placebo in improving social function as measured by the Vineland-3 social domain.","Inclusion Criteria:||Signed Written Informed Consent||Participants or their legal representative must have signed and dated an IRB/IEC approved written informed consent form in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines.

Though research progress pertaining to FraX has been extraordinary in many areas, many critical gaps in knowledge remain. In particular, there is a dearth of information on treatments designed to address the often-serious cognitive and behavioral symptoms of FraX. Like many other developmental disorders, descriptions of treatments for FraX that do exist in the literature are primarily derived from uncontrolled case studies or series, with both pharmacological and behavioral interventions targeted to symptoms associated with phenomenologically defined ""co-morbid"" diagnoses such as AD/HD, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or anxiety disorders. These circumstances are suboptimal as such symptom-based treatments represent a low level of specificity with respect to the underlying pathogenesis of cognitive and behavioral problems. Accordingly, new research to develop more effective, disease-specific treatments for persons with FraX is greatly needed.||Converging evidence from our research group and others strongly support a hypothesis of functional cholinergic deficits contributing to cognitive-behavioral dysfunction in FraX. This evidence includes: (1) abnormalities of cholinergic pathway function and neurochemistry observed with functional MRI and 1H-MRS, respectively, in FraX, (2) an analysis of FMR1 expression during human fetal development indicating particularly high expression in cholinergic brain regions, (3) cholinergic system abnormalities detected in the mouse and fly models of FraX, (4) an analysis of the specific profile of cognitive and behavioral deficits in FraX in relation to current knowledge of cholinergic system functions, and, (5) significant improvements in cognition and behavior observed in 12 individuals with FraX during an open-label trial of donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor. Accordingly, the proposed project will consist of a double blind, placebo controlled trial of donepezil in 50 individuals with FraX, ages 12 to 29 years. The primary hypothesis is that subjects receiving donepezil will show greater improvements in specific measures of behavior and cognition, relative to the placebo group. In addition to direct benefit to persons affected by FraX, findings from the proposed research are likely to be highly relevant to subgroups of (currently) idiopathic developmental disorders, such as autism, that might share common pathophysiological mechanisms of disease with FraX. Such shared mechanisms could occur through intersecting pathways involving FMR1 protein function or as a result of similarities in the contribution of cholinergic dysfunction to cognitive and behavioral disability.","Inclusion Criteria:||confirmed genetic diagnosis of fragile X syndrome|age >=12, <=29|Verbal IQ >= 50, <=75|Tanner pubertal stage >= 3||Exclusion Criteria:||Current or lifetime DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychotic disorder, NOS based upon reported history|Poorly controlled seizure disorder or taking more than one anticonvulsant (subjects cannot be prescribed carbamazepine, phenytoin, or phenobarbital due to potential interaction effects with donepezil).

Approximately 10 Canadian children per 10 000 live births suffer from the disorder, which is three to four times more common in males than in females. It is characterized by social and and communicative deficits and restricted, repetitive interests and behaviours. Most autistic children are delayed in the acquisition of both verbal and non-verbal communication skills and many never develop useful language. Three-quarters of autistic children have mild to severe mental retardation and a quarter develop seizures during later childhood or adolescence. Its etiology is heterogenous and there is no cure. Although behaviour therapy is an important tool in management, pharmacotherapy remains a necessity for many children. Current therapy is limited to antipsychotic drugs that can carry an unacceptable risk of chronic neurotoxicity (tardive dyskinesia) or tricyclic antidepressants that have undesireble cardiovascular effects.

SPECIFIC AIMS||To investigate the safety of clinical use of ziprasidone in children|To investigate the dosages that have been employed clinically.||II. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE||Ziprasidone, a recently released atypical agent is likely to be as effective as other neuroleptics in treating psychiatric symptoms in children, but may have the considerable health advantage of not causing weight gain. Ziprasidone administration has been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval (mean=20 msec), an electrocardiographic measure of ventricular repolarization (Federal Drug Administration, 2000). There are no reports regarding the use of ziprasidone in autism, and data regarding the safety and efficacy of ziprasidone in children is extremely limited. The only published study of ziprasidone in children found that it was safe and effective in treating Tourette's syndrome in children aged 7 to 17 years of age (Sallee et al, 2000). Because children are being treated with ziprasidone despite a paucity of safety data, it is important to begin to collect and review available data, including that from clinical usage. Some children who receive services within the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Services of Drexel University College of Medicine have been treated with ziprasidone. The charts of the children and adolescents will contain data regarding exposure to ziprasidone and laboratory data and ECG's that can be reviewed to determine whether ziprasidone treatment has been associated with changes in weight, laboratory values and ECG's. We propose to review the charts of patients who have been treated with our services since March 1, 2001 XXX because such patients may have been exposed to ziprasidone (ziprasidone received FDA approval on February 5, 2001).||III. DESIGN AND METHODS||A. Setting: The setting for this study will be the Specialty Clinic for Pervasive Developmental Disorders, part of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic at Eastern Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute.||B. Subjects: Subjects will be 15 children and adolescents who meet the DSM-IV Criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorder.||C. Design: This is a 6-week pilot study employing open treatment with ziprasidone. Subjects will be rated at baseline and thereafter assessed weekly.||D. Medication: Subjects will be treated openly with ziprasidone. Should untoward effects occur, the dosage of the medication will be reduced or the medication will be discontinued, as clinically appropriate. Subjects will not receive other concomitant psychotropic medication during the study. Medication will be taken concomitant with food.||Ziprasidone Dosing Strategy: Ziprasidone tablets (5, 10, and 20 mg) will be employed for the study. The dosage range for ziprasidone will be 5 mg/day to 40 mg/day. Every effort will be made to reach and maintain a therapeutic dosage by week four of the treatment phase.||For subjects who weigh less than 25 kg, starting dosage will be 5 mg/every other day. After 3 days, the dosage can be increased to 5 mg. By week 2, subjects can be increased to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 20 mg increments weekly.|For subjects who weigh greater than 25 kg, the starting dosage will be 5 mg/day. After three days, the dosage can be increased to 10 mg/day. By week two, subjects can be increased to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 20 mg increments weekly as needed.||Note: Should 5 mg tablets not be available, the dosing schedule will be altered to have a starting dosage of 10 mg, and dosage increases will be made in 10 mg increments.||F. Measures||Primary efficacy measure: The Clinical Global Impressions (CGI; Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The efficacy of treatments can be judged on their ability to enhance global functioning, an assessment that is particularly relative in a pilot study. The CGI consists of three global scales measuring severity of illness, global improvement, and drug effect, and has been useful in measuring drug treatment effect in this population (see Campbell and Palij, 1985). The PI and another trained rater will complete this scale. Although only members of the research team generally complete this scale, it will additionally be completed by the subject's parent/caretaker. Having it completed by the parent/caretaker will take only minutes and may result in useful data. This measure will be completed weekly beginning at baseline.|Secondary efficacy measure: Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale (Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The CPRS was developed by the Psychopharmacology Branch of the NIMH to rate childhood psychopathology. Each of the items is rated from ""1"" (not present) to ""7"" (extremely severe). The first 28 items of this scale require no verbal response on the part of the subject, making them appropriate for rating children and adolescents with Pervasive Developmental Disorder. Of these 28 items, 14 are particularly relevant in autism (see Campbell and Palij, 1985): they assess the symptoms for which drug treatment is indicated including hyperactivity, aggression, self-abusive behavior, temper tantrums, lability of mood, irritability, social withdrawal, and stereotypies. A composite sum of these 14 items, the CPRS-14, will be constructed and employed as a secondary outcome measure, a procedure used by a number of investigators (Anderson et al, 1989; Campbell et al, 1986, 1989, 1993; Findling et al, 1997; Sanchez et al, 1996). We analyzed our data using the CPRS-14; the ICC was 0.8978. In addition, 4 factors derived from these 14 items will be examined. They include: autism, anger/uncooperativeness, hyperactivity, and speech deviance (Overall and Campbell, 1988). This measure will be completed at baseline and at the end of treatment.|Safety measures: (1) A physical exam will be completed at baseline. (2) Height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse will be obtained and recorded at baseline and at each visit during the study. (3) The following laboratory measures will be obtained at baseline and repeated at the end of the treatment phase: complete blood count with differential, liver functions, and electrocardiogram. Serum prolactin will be obtained at baseline and at the end of the treatment phase. These laboratory studies will be repeated at the end of the treatment phase of the study. Any other clinically appropriate tests and evaluations will also be completed whenever needed.||Untoward effects will be measured and recorded at each visit employing the following measures: (1) Dosage Record and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (DOTES); (2) Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale (TESS); (3) Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) (all from Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985); and (4) the Neurologic Rating Scale (Simpson and Angus, 1970). The DOTES and TESS measure a wide range of possible untoward effects. The AIMS measures dyskinesias. The Neurologic Rating Scale measures other forms of extrapyramidal effects that can occur with neuroleptics such as dystonias, parkinsonian effects, and akathisia.||G. Procedures: All patients appropriate to the study and their parent/caretakers will be approached and informed consent and assent (in subjects under 14 years) will be obtained. Subjects meeting the Inclusion Criteria, but not the Exclusion Criteria, will enter the baseline period of the study.||Baseline (week 0): Subjects will be rated at baseline employing the CGI and the CPRS.||End of Treatment (week 6): At the end of the treatment period, subjects will again be rated employing the CGI and the CPRS (selected items).||In addition, each subject will be rated on the CGI at each visit so that data from the last visit is available should the subject terminate the study prematurely. If it is known that a subject will terminate the study at a visit before week 6, the subject will be rated with the CGI and the CPRS at that visit.||All safety measures will be completed at each visit. Laboratory measures and EKG will be obtained in the morning.||I. Analysis: This is a pilot study whose purpose is to get initial safety and efficacy data with ziprasidone in children with autism. We will perform an ANOVA, repeated measures, for CGI severity scores, the CPRS-14 and the CPRS factors. Similar analyses will be performed for safety measures including for weight, prolactin and other laboratory measures, and EKG indices.","Inclusion Criteria:||Diagnosis of autism (DSM-IV) made by a boarded child and adolescent psychiatrist.|Males and females.|Aged 12 to 18 years.|Clinical judgment that medication treatment for autism is indicated.||Exclusion Criteria:||Major medical problems including cardiac, liver, endocrine, or renal diseases.|History of seizure disorder or gross neurological deficit.|Baseline QTC greater than 425 msec.|Concomitant treatment with psychotropic medication.|History of prior exposure to ziprasidone.",15.0,Actual,All,No,,1 Open Label,"Ziprasidone 40mg to 60mg per day, individually titrated",Ziprasidone,Drug,"June 17, 2010",Estimate,"June 15, 2010",OTHER,Drexel University College of Medicine,Philadelphia,United States,Drexel University College of Medicine at Friends Hospital,938,Pennsylvania,18 Years,12 Years,Ziprasidone in Children With Autism: A Pilot Study,Drexel University,Drexel University College of Medicine,Completed,Yes,Phase 2,June 2005,Actual,,Clinical Global Impressions,Week 6,,,,938,,,,20 minute video of a therapist-child interaction in the clinic with a standard set of age-appropriate toys.|Parent report of child's expressive vocabulary and prelinguistic communication skills,Expressive vocabulary of the child as measured by transcribing and coding a 20 minute video of a therapist-child interaction in the clinic with a standard set of age-appropriate toys.|MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (MCDI) (Child),Two months after the start of the study|Two months after the start of the study,August 2015,Actual,July 2021,Child,"December 17, 2015",Estimate,"December 8, 2015","December 16, 2015",Interventional,"December 16, 2021",,No

What is yet unknown is precisely how imitation in children with ASD differs from that of typically developing peers.The investigators have identified a task parameter that separates preserved from impaired gesture imitation in ASD: children with ASD have difficulty imitating when the task requires two separate movement elements be coordinated simultaneously. By contrast, imitation is relatively preserved when movement elements are performed serially. The coordination of simultaneous movements is a hallmark of actions performed in the real world. With an eye to optimizing common therapies that depend heavily on imitation, the next step is to tease apart where, in the chain from perception to action, the capacity limitation in simultaneous processing lies.

982,982,983,NCT02124720,,Use of the iSTIM mobile application 2 to 4 times per week over approximately 8 to 16 weeks,Behavioral: iSTIM,Mobile application,Experimental,"Nearly all children with autism spectrum disorders engage in non-functional repetitive vocal and motor behaviours commonly referred to as stereotypy. These repetitive behaviours may considerably interfere with the child's daily functioning, learning, and social inclusion. As such, stereotypy generally has a negative impact on the child and family's health and quality of life. Several behavioural interventions have been developed to reduce engagement in stereotypy in children with autism spectrum disorders, but the limited number of specialists available, the long waiting lists associated with public health services in Canada, and the high costs of private services have considerably restricted accessibility. One potential solution to the limited availability and high costs of services is using a mobile application to recommend, teach, and monitor interventions designed to reduce engagement in stereotypy. To this end, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of the iSTIM (i.e., individualized Stereotypy Treatment Integrated Modules), a mobile application designed to assist parents in reducing stereotypy in children with autism spectrum disorders. Specifically, we will assess whether the iSTIM correctly estimates the frequency or duration of stereotypy, offers suggestions consistent with recommended clinical practices, effectively reduces engagement in stereotypy, and is socially acceptable, safe, and easy to use for parents of children with autism spectrum disorders. The results of the study will allow us to determine whether the mobile application may be used to treat this core symptom in children with autism spectrum disorders, which could potentially reduce waiting times and costs of providing health services to this population. By reducing engagement in stereotypy, the iSTIM may also promote and facilitate the social participation as well as improve the quality of life and health of children with autism spectrum disorders and their families.",Using Mobile Technology to Reduce Stereotypy,,,February 2019,Actual,"Child Development Disorders, Pervasive","Autism Spectrum Disorder|Child Development Disorders, Pervasive|Child Development Disorders|Stereotypy",,Single Group Assignment,None (Open Label),Treatment,,983,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Adult and adolescent patients, 14-50 years of age|Diagnosis of fragile X syndrome with a confirmed fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) full mutation and qualifying scores on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and CGI-S|Patients must agree to either remain completely abstinent or to use two effective contraceptive methods during and 3 weeks after the study||Exclusion Criteria:||Previous treatment with another metabotropic glutamate (mGLU) receptor antagonist within 18 months or with RO4917523|Participation in a clinical trial involving an investigational (unapproved) drug within 3 months or 5 times the half-life (whichever is longer) before start of this study|Any uncontrolled, unstable clinically significant psychiatric condition other than fragile X syndrome|History of suicidal behavior",185.0,Actual,All,No,,Placebo|RO4917523 0.5 mg|RO4917523 1.5 mg,placebo to RO4917523 orally once a day for 12 weeks|0.5 mg orally once a day for 12 weeks|1.5 mg orally once a day for 12 weeks,Placebo|RO4917523 0.5 mg|RO4917523 1.5 mg,Drug|Drug|Drug,"July 11, 2016",Estimate,"July 6, 2016",INDUSTRY,Hoffmann-La Roche,Phoenix|Long Beach|Sacramento|Aurora|Washington|Decatur|Chicago|Iowa City|Louisville|Baltimore|Worcester|New York|Staten Island|Durham|Cincinnati|Media|Nashville|Houston|San Antonio|Seattle|Bahia Blanca|Caba|Caba|Brampton|Sherbrooke|Santiago|Valparaiso|Bordeaux|Bron|Dijon|Marseille|Montpellier|Paris|Tours|Aguascalientes|Mexico|Lima|Lima|San Cugat del Valles|San Sebastian|Torremolinos|El Palmar.
