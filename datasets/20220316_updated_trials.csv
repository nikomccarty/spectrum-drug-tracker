These symptoms are associated with increased social deficits, depression, irritability, and stereotyped and self-injurious behaviors. Children and adolescents with anxiety also frequently avoid potentially stressful situations, thereby missing opportunities to learn important new skills. Despite the significant consequences of anxiety symptoms, several critical treatment-relevant issues remain unresolved. First, there is a lack of clarity about how to differentiate ASD and anxiety symptoms. Second, little is known about how anxiety manifests in those with ASD and intellectual disability (ID). Third, the neural substrates of anxiety in ASD are poorly understood. The overarching goal of this project is to investigate these open issues in order to make interventions more precise, more personalized, and more likely to promote positive outcomes -- an objective consistent with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Roadmap, Precision Medicine, and Research Domain Criteria Project (RDoC) Initiatives and the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) Strategic Plan, Chapter 4.||While there is no doubt that anxiety is a very serious issue for those with ASD, what to do about this problem is less clear. The search for empirically-validated treatments has begun with multiple small trials providing promising evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) might reduce anxiety in those with ASD. However, this work is in its early stages. There is a great need for large, rigorously designed trials that validate the effectiveness of both medication and CBT, as well as functional neuroimaging studies that identify neural predictors of treatment efficacy and markers of therapy-induced change. Such work holds the potential to help answer the questions posed above and to assist the field in developing more personalized treatments. In Project 1 of the Center for the Development of Phenotype-Based Treatments of Autism Spectrum Disorder, we will conduct a study in children with ASD and clinically significant anxiety ages 8-14 to compare efficacy of these different treatment types.||The overall aims of the study are to better characterize the sub-group of children and preadolescents with ASD that exhibit clinically significant anxiety and fears through a 16-week randomized comparative treatment trial of Behavioral Intervention for Anxiety in Children with Autism (BIACA), sertraline, and placebo in youth with ASD, IQ>50, and clinically significant anxiety as assessed by a PARS score that is greater than or equal to 8. Clinician-administered gold standard assays will be used of traditional DSM (Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale [PARS] and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-IV [ADIS-IV]), and nontraditional ASD related anxiety symptoms (Autism Spectrum Addendum to the ADIS [ASDD]), as well as parent reports of potentially overlapping symptoms that complicate the ASD anxiety phenotype. Additionally fMRI will be used to investigate neural predictors of treatment efficacy, markers of treatment induced change, and signatures of anxiety sub-types.","Inclusion Criteria:||Outpatient boys and girls with ASD between ages 8-14 years at consent.|Meets criteria for a diagnosis of ASD.|Meets criteria for clinically significant anxiety symptoms as defined by a minimum score of 8 on the PARS Severity Scale.|Meets criteria for clinically significant anxiety symptoms as defined by qualifying for diagnosis on 1 or more non-phobia items on the ADIS.|The child has a Verbal Comprehension IQ greater than 50 as assessed on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence or other standardized cognitive measure.|Anxiety symptoms are considered the primary mental health problem (i.e., most impairing/distressing)|Stable medication regimen for 8 weeks prior to screening visit, including alternative medication, nutritionals, or therapeutic diets.||Stable non-psychotherapy regimen for 4 weeks prior to screening visits.

Effective early treatments that account for ADHD symptoms have not been developed for young children with ASD+ADHD. The overarching goals of this randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2, pilot study are to (1) evaluate a novel early intervention that pharmacologically addresses ADHD symptoms while providing an ASD-targeted behavioral intervention, and (2) identify changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie improved outcomes in children with comorbid ASD and ADHD ages 3-10 years. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether a stimulant treatment augments efficacy of an ASD specific form of parent child therapy based on the Early Start Denver Model called ESDM influenced Parent Coaching. Secondary aims are to determine the efficacy of combined intervention in improving ADHD symptoms and the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Adzenys-XR-ODT in young children with ASD+ADHD. The study will also examine correlations between behavioral changes and state-of-the-art eye-gaze tracking (EGT) and electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers to elucidate key ways in which ADHD impacts attentional and neural functioning in ASD+ADHD, and to potentially identify new targets for intervention in children with ASD+ADHD. The study is about 8 months long and will involve screening, baseline assessment followed by 10- 11 weeks of study drug treatment (active or placebo) and 8 sessions of ESDM informed parent coaching beginning after 2 weeks of study drug treatment, primary endpoint assessments at ~11 weeks, AE follow-up by phone at ~week 13 and remote FU 24 weeks after baseline. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to the active medication or placebo, Between weeks 11 to 24, it is expected that the parent will use the behavioral strategies they were coached in even though they will not receive parent coaching.

It is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of metformin (also known as Glumetza, Glucophage, Fortamet), a type 2 diabetes medication that can also improve obesity and excessive appetite.||Metformin has emerged as a candidate drug for the targeted treatment of FXS based on animal studies showing rescue of multiple phenotypes in the FXS model. Metformin may contribute to normalizing signaling pathways in FXS in the central nervous system, which may include activities of mTOR and PI3K, both of which have shown to be pathogenically overactive in FXS. In addition, metformin inhibits phosphodiesterase, which would lead to correction of cAMP levels, and MMP9 production, which is also elevated in FXS. Looking at the potential signaling pathways, metformin appears to be a good candidate for targeting several of the intracellular functions in neurons disrupted in FXS and, therefore, has potential to rescue several types of symptoms in individuals with FXS. The researchers have utilized metformin in the clinical treatment of over 20 individuals with FXS between the ages of 4 and 58 years and have found the medication to be well tolerated and to provide benefits not only in lowering weight gain and normalizing appetite but also in language and behavior. In this controlled trial, the researchers hope to further assess metformin's safety and benefits in the areas of language and cognition, eating and weight loss, and overall behavior.||Each participant will be involved in this trial for a period of 4 months. This will include 3 visits to the UC Davis MIND Institute and 5 phone calls. At each visit, the researchers will assess behavioral, cognitive, and language development.

The sum of responses on a scale of 0 to 3 for each of the 28 questions generates the overall score, which ranges from 0 to 84. Lower scores indicate lower severity of symptoms, while higher scores indicate higher severity of symptoms. It will be completed by the caregiver at baseline, Week 8, and End of Treatment/Week 16 visits.|The CSHQ consists of a series of questions relating to the sleep habits of children. It will be completed by caregivers of all participants, regardless of participant age, at the baseline, Week 8, and End of Treatment/Week 16 visits.|The SNAP-IV, based on DSM-V criteria for ADHD, is a caregiver-rated questionnaire that effectively identifies those with and without ADHD and accurately predicts presentation specifier (inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and combined). Its psychometric properties and clinical utility have been demonstrated in multiple studies since its introduction in 2001, and it has been found to be reliable and well validated with normative data from both parents and teachers. It will be completed by caregivers of all participants at baseline, Week 8, and End of Treatment/Week 16.|The PedsQL Parent Proxy consists of a series of questions relating to a child's quality of life and is administered to the caregiver of the participant. The parent proxy module designed for children 8-12 years of age will be administered to the caregivers of all participants, regardless of participant age, because the questions therein are most appropriate for the overall study population's cognitive age and ability. It will be completed at the baseline, Week 8, and End of Treatment/Week 16 visits. For any participants not in school, questions pertaining to ""school"" will be replaced with references to ""work"" or other activities in their life.","Change from baseline in the FXS-normed Aberrant Behavior Checklist - Community Edition (ABC-C)|Improvement of symptoms in FXS using the Clinical Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) scale|Change from baseline in the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)|Change from baseline in the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Third Edition (VABS-III) Adaptive Behavior Composite Score|Change from baseline in the Anxiety Depression and Mood Screen (ADAMS) overall score|Change from baseline in the Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) overall score|Change from baseline in the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham Questionnaire (SNAP-IV) overall score|Change from baseline in the Pediatric Quality of Life Questionnaire (PedsQL) Parent Proxy overall score","Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16|Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16",30-Apr-18,Actual,Feb-22,Child|Adult,27-Mar-18,Actual,20-Mar-18,20-Mar-18,Interventional,16-Mar-22,,Yes
