The turmoil caused by self-injurious behaviors in children with ASD invariably interferes with daily routines because family life often stops during these episodes and family members worry about setting off SIB between episodes. This project will use the detailed assessment methods developed in the field of behavior therapy to evaluate the potential for N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to treat children with ASD and moderate repetitive SIB. NAC is an over-the-counter dietary supplement that may have beneficial effects on the brain through its well-documented antioxidant effects and/or reduced glutamate signaling. In the proposed study, 14 children with ASD and repetitive SIB between the ages of 5 and 12 will be randomly assigned to gradually increasing doses of NAC or placebo for 9 weeks. The research team, parents and children will be blind to the treatment with NAC or placebo. Participants will come to the research site periodically to complete measures and behavioral assessments.||After the 9 weeks of treatment, children randomized to NAC who showed improvement will be encouraged to continue taking the supplement outside the study. Children who were randomly assigned to the placebo and showed no improvement will be offered open-label treatment with NAC. Children who did not improve while taking NAC or those who improved while on the placebo will be advised on next steps by the study team.||The goal of this feasibility study is establish the acceptability viability of study procedures in this vulnerable population, to learn about the potential benefits and adverse effects of NAC.

205,205,206,,8-week treatment with gabapentin,Drug: Gabapentin,Gabapentin Open-label treatment,Experimental,"The social cognitive deficits associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are related to an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, specifically a deficit in the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. The investigators have used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques to measure GABA in specific brain regions and have demonstrated that a single dose of gabapentin increases GABA in brain regions associated with social cognition. This study will use a biomarker-driven approach to investigate gabapentin to correct the underlying imbalance of neurotransmitters and improve the core social cognitive deficits in ASD. By using a brain-based biomarker (GABA) that is quantifiable and measurable, the investigators can target this biomarker directly and measure the impact of the treatment. This will help with the future development of targeted therapies for ASD and provide an early marker of response to aid in the selection of individuals more likely to respond to various treatments. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) determine if treatment with gabapentin sustainably increases GABA in the right anterior insula (RAI; an area of the brain involved in social cognition), 2) determine if response of RAI GABA levels to a single dose challenge of gabapentin predicts a sustained response after treatment, and 3) determine if the increase in GABA levels with gabapentin treatment translates into clinically measurable improvement in social cognition. The investigators will conduct an 8-week open-label clinical trial of gabapentin in 40 adolescents (age 13-17 years) with ASD, using MRS before and after treatment to measure GABA in the RAI (the primary outcome for the study). Before the trial, a single dose challenge of gabapentin will be used to evaluate the immediate response of GABA levels in the RAI, to determine if this predicts later response. A secondary outcome will be the clinical effects of gabapentin on social cognition. This study can demonstrate for the first time that neuroimaging biomarkers can be used to guide treatment of social cognition deficits seen in ASD and that the excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in neurotransmitters in ASD can be pharmacologically targeted. This can provide a rational basis for pharmacological treatment of the core social deficits of ASD, providing direct benefit to participants in the study as well as indirect benefit to countless patients in the future.",Biomarker-Driven Pharmacological Treatment of Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorder With Gabapentin,lauren.venuti@umassmed.edu|david.cochran@umassmed.edu,"Lauren Venuti|David Cochran, MD",Contact|Contact,November 2023,Anticipated,Autism Spectrum Disorder,Autism|Autism Spectrum Disorder|Autism Spectrum Disorder,D000001321|D000067877|D000002659,"Autistic Disorder|Autism Spectrum Disorder|Child Development Disorders, Pervasive",,Single Group Assignment,None (Open Label),,206,Treatment,,,"Outline of Research Plan The investigators will recruit 40 adolescents with ASD (age 13-17) to participate in an 8-week open label clinical trial of gabapentin, with wraparound neuroimaging to assess the primary outcome of Aim 1 (response of RAI GABA levels to 8 weeks of gabapentin treatment) and Aim 2 (evaluation of acute response to gabapentin as a predictor of response at 8 weeks). Clinical measures of social cognition described below will be obtained to address Aim 3 (to assess for clinically measurable improvements in social cognition deficits).||Clinical Assessments The subjects will be assessed with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) to confirm the diagnosis of ASD. The Ohio Autism Clinical Impressions Scale will assess overall severity of autism-specific symptoms. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID 7.0.2) will be used to document comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. The Weschler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence (WASI-2) will be used to assess IQ. Social cognition deficits will be assessed using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test (RMET), the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2), and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II (VABS-II) Socialization subdomain. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist, Community version (ABC), will be used to quantify behavioral measures associated with ASD. To assess whether clinical improvements with gabapentin extend beyond effects on social cognition, other symptom domains will be assessed pre- and post-treatment as well. Specifically, information on repetitive and/or compulsive behaviors will be obtained using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (CY-BOCS-PDD). The ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD RS-IV) will be used to assess ADHD symptoms, the Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS) to assess depressive symptoms and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, 2nd edition, (MASC-2) will be used to assess anxiety-related symptoms.||In addition to traditional outcome measures for social functioning in ASD, including parent report measures (SRS-2) and theory of mind tasks (RMET), a novel technique of measuring social motor coordination will be used that was developed as a potential outcome measure in ASD clinical trials. This assessment involves a video-based analysis of whole-body social motor coordination during a more naturalistic task, the conversation task of an ADOS-2 administration. Changes in social motor coordination will be evaluated in relation to changes in GABA levels with treatment over the course of the clinical trial.||Baseline MRI T1- and T2-weighted high-resolution structural imaging (T1- and T2-weighted (MPRAGE)) will be acquired, along with a baseline MRS using MEsher-Garwood Point REsolved Spectroscopy Sequence (MEGA-PRESS: TE: 68 ms, TR: 2 s) to quantify GABA in a 4 cm x 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm voxel localized in the RAI. Imaging sessions will be conducted at the Advanced MRI Center (AMRIC) at UMMS, which houses a 3.0 Tesla Philips Achieva MRI research scanner (Philips Healthcare, Best, Netherlands) and 8 element phase-array receiver SENSE head coil.||The baseline MRI protocol also leverages collaborations with the Human Connectome (HCP) and Adolescent Brain Cognitive Developments (ABCD) projects and is designed to support integration with national multi-site studies for added protocol utility. The scan session will include 1) a 3D T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo scan for cortical and subcortical segmentation (6.5 min); 2) a 3D T2-weighted variable flip angle fast spin echo scan for screening out white matter lesions and quantification of CSF (6 min); 3) a diffusion imaging scan, for segmentation of white matter tracts and measurement of diffusion parameters (1.5mm isotropic, b=1000; 110 directions acquired with both AP and PA phase encoding; 2 x 5 min); 4) a resting state fMRI scan (2mm isotropic ; TR 750 ms; AP, PA phase encoding; (2-5.75 min runs).||Acute Response of GABA levels A second MRS scan will be obtained two hours after an approximately 20 mg/kg challenge with gabapentin to obtain the acute response for Aim 2. Subjects will receive a single dose of gabapentin. The dose used will be calculated to provide the highest possible dose to the nearest 100 mg without exceeding 1500 mg or 20 mg/kg, whichever is lower. The weight exclusion criteria ensures that all subjects will receive at least 17 mg/kg dose. All subjects will be monitored for adverse effects for up to 4 hours following administration of the single dose and will have direct phone access to the principal investigator (24 hours/ 7 days a week) for reporting of any post-observation adverse effects. A blood sample to assess drug level will be taken as close to 3 hours after administration as possible, allowing time for imaging scan and transport to clinical trials unit for blood draw. This will be used to control for variability in bioavailability in interpreting the cortical GABA level changes.|Clinical Trial of Gabapentin The study involves an 8-week open-label clinical trial with gabapentin in 40 adolescents age 13-17 years who meet DSM-5 criteria for ASD. At the acute gabapentin dosing visit, baseline safety labs will be obtained, including complete blood count; comprehensive metabolic panel including electrolytes, renal function tests, and liver function tests; and creatine kinase. Baseline EKG will be obtained as well. The above labs will be repeated at week 4 and week 8 of the clinical trial, or if adverse events occur which indicate the need for testing.||At baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, and 8, the following clinical measures will be obtained: OACIS-S, OACIS-I (for post-baseline visits). At baseline and at 8 weeks, the following assessments will also be administered: VABS-II, SRS-2 (modified to ask about symptoms in previous 2 weeks), RMET, ABC, CY-BOCS-PDD, ADHD-RS-IV, MASC-2, and CDRS-R. ADOS-2 will also be re-administered at week 8 for videotape assessment of social motor coordination as described above. At week 8, a trough serum gabapentin level will be obtained to account for variability in bioavailability as a potential confounding factor. At week 8, the MRS scan will be repeated to evaluate RAI GABA levels, and also include a resting state functional MRI scan.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Age 13-17 years|English as primary language (both child and legal guardian)|DSM-5 criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder|IQ >70 per Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI)|Informed assent for the study (The guardian must also give written informed consent)|For sexually active females, agreement to use two forms of contraception during trial to avoid pregnancy||Exclusion Criteria:||Any neurological disorder (e.g., cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome, cerebral neoplasm, bacterial meningitis, epilepsy, etc.)|Genetic disorders (e.g., Fragile X, Rett Syndrome, etc.)|Contraindications for MRI, such as metallic or electronic implants in the body, or severe claustrophobia|Unstable psychiatric disorder expected to require psychotropic medication changes over the course of the study|History of psychotic disorder|Any condition that would prevent the subject from being able to complete study protocol|Unstable medical illness such as diabetes, asthma, thyroid disease|Currently on medications that cause respiratory depression, e.g. opioids, benzodiazepines|Clinically significant suicidal ideation as assessed by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale|History of intolerance to gabapentin or pregabalin|Current substance use (including nicotine)|Current treatment with gabapentin|History of renal dysfunction|Subjects who weigh more than 88 kg|Pregnancy in female participants.",40.0,Anticipated,,,,,,All,No,Yes,Gabapentin Open-label treatment,206,"8 weeks of gabapentin, titrated up to 20 mg/kg in 3 divided doses daily",Gabapentin,,Drug,Yes,,"October 8, 2021",Actual,"September 30, 2021",OTHER,David Cochran,Worcester,,,United States,University of Massachusetts Medical School,Massachusetts,,17 Years,13 Years,206,NCT03195465,The Effect of High Antioxidant Cacao on Behaviors in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder,OTHER,Loma Linda University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,206,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UMass Medical School,206,"David Cochran, MD",Principal Investigator,Not yet recruiting,No,Phase 4,,,,November 2023,Anticipated,Cortical GABA Levels in right anterior insula as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy,Right Anterior Insula GABA level,8 weeks,,,"University of Massachusetts, Worcester",David Cochran,Assistant Professor of Psychiatry and Pediatrics,Sponsor-Investigator,,206,Actual,"August 22, 2018","April 19, 2021",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"November 14, 2017",Actual,May 2021,206,Child|Adult,"June 22, 2017",Actual,"June 20, 2017","June 20, 2017",,Interventional,"November 04, 2021",PI left institution.

Cannabidivarin (CBDV) is a nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid and a safe variant of Cannabidiol (CBD). It has no appreciable tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) [less than 0.01%], has been shown to have no impact on weight or metabolism, and improves both social and cognitive functioning in animal models of idiopathic and syndromal autism (Fragile X, Rett Syndrome, Angelman Syndrome). The CDC currently estimates 1 in 59 children have ASD. ASD is characterized by deficits in social communication, irritability, repetitive behaviors, impulsivity, temper tantrums, and high caregiver burden. Currently, the only FDA-approved medications for symptoms of ASD are aripiprazole and risperidone, both of which are indicated for irritability in pediatric ASD. These medications are effective but are associated with considerable side effects with long term treatment in this chronic developmental disorder, including weight gain, metabolic syndrome and the risk of type 2 diabetes, prolactin elevation and growth of breast tissue, extrapyramidal symptoms and the risk of tardive dyskinesia. The anticonvulsant divalproex sodium (valproate/VPA) also significantly reduces irritability and repetitive behaviors in individuals with ASD. Although VPA is efficacious for pediatric epilepsy and some symptoms of ASD, it also has significant side effects, including weight gain, sedation and nausea. CBDV, like VPA, is effective in the treatment of pediatric epilepsy, and ASD mouse models demonstrate potential mechanisms for treatment with CBDV, including potential therapeutic effects on repetitive behaviors, irritability, sociability, and quality of life, and the capacity to reduce inflammation. This study aims to examine the efficacy and safety of cannabidivarin (CBDV) with a primary aim of studying its effect on irritability in children with ASD.||STUDY DESIGN: This is a 12-week randomized, double-blind study of CBDV vs. placebo in 100 child and adolescent subjects aged 5 to 18 years with a diagnosis of ASD.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria||Male or Female pediatric outpatients aged between and including ages 5 to 18.

The Centers for Disease Control estimates that ASD affects as many as 17 per 1000 children (1 in 59) in the United States suggesting that the prevalence is higher than previous estimates.Despite the dramatic rise in the detected prevalence of ASD over the past two decades, there is no effective medical treatment for core ASD symptoms (social communication and repetitive behavior), the closely associated problem of language impairment, or the underlying pathophysiology of ASD. Currently, the only accepted treatment for core ASD symptoms is behavior therapy, which may entail intensive one-on-one treatment over several years.||The primary aims of this study are to evaluate the effect of a wide-spectrum nutritional supplement on mitochondrial function in individuals with ASD. Participants entered into the trial will have abnormalities in mitochondrial function that are known to be associated with ASD (approximately 50+% of children with ASD) but are not diagnostic of mitochondrial disease. The investigators hypothesize that nutritional supplements designed for children with ASD have a physiological action of normalizing mitochondrial function and cellular physiology throughout the body.||To test whether the targeted nutritional supplement is superior to placebo, the investigators will study 50 children, between the ages of 4 years to 14 years, with confirmed ASD and known abnormal variations in mitochondrial at baseline. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive active treatment or placebo for 12-weeks under double-blind conditions and at the end of the 12 weeks switch to the opposite condition after a 2-week wash out period. Mitochondrial function will be measured at baseline and after each treatment arm in order to determine if the supplement positively influences cellular biochemistry. The investigator will also evaluate the effectiveness of the supplement on core and associated ASD symptoms using several behaviors assessments.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Weight ≥ 15 kg and ≤ 100kg;|DSM-5 diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder as established by formal clinical assessment which includes a gold-standard tool such as the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule.|Current Clinical Global Impression Severity score ≥ 4|Stable educational and therapy plan (one month) with no planned changes in the intensity of treatment for 12 weeks.|English is spoken in the home and at least one parent is able to read, write and speak English.|Stable medication (no changes in past 6 weeks and no planned changes for the study duration.|Electron Transport Chain Complex (I, II, III, IV) or Citrate Synthase Activity which is >= 2.0 Standard Deviation Above or Below Average (outside the normal range)||Exclusion Criteria:||Presence of serious behavioral problems (tantrums, aggression, self-injury) for which another treatment is warranted.|Current Clinical Global Impression Severity score < 7 (Extremely Ill)|Significant medical condition by history or by physical examination or lab tests that would be incompatible with the treatment.|Children taking anticonvulsant medication for seizures or active epilepsy.|Diagnosis of Mitochondrial Disease",50.0,Anticipated,,,,,,All,No,No,Wide-spectrum nutritional supplement|Placebo control,349,Comprehensive powder with 33 dietary supplements and 1 dietary supplement via gel capsule.|Inactive placebo comparator,Wide-spectrum nutritional supplement|Placebo,"NeuroNeeds: Spectrum Needs, NeuroNeeds:Q Needs",Drug|Other,Yes,,"March 15, 2021",Actual,"March 11, 2021",OTHER,Phoenix Children's Hospital,Phoenix,rfrye@phoenixchildrens.com,"Richard E Frye, MD, PhD|Richard E Frye, MD, PhD|Richard Boles, MD",United States,Phoenix Children's Hospital,Arizona,Recruiting,17 Years,2 Years,349,NCT04078061,Comparative Effectiveness of EIBI and Adaptive ABA for Children With Autism,OTHER,University of Rochester,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,349,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Phoenix Children's Hospital,349,"Richard E Frye, MD, PhD",Principal Investigator,Recruiting,No,Phase 2,,,,April 2022,Anticipated,"Mitochondrial activity and redox metabolism at baseline and after the placebo and supplement arms of the study, as determined through laboratory assessment.",Change in mitochondrial activity in study patients,"Baseline, Week 12, Week 24","Delhey LM, Nur Kilinc E, Yin L, Slattery JC, Tippett ML, Rose S, Bennuri SC, Kahler SG, Damle S, Legido A, Goldenthal MJ, Frye RE.

Medications used are mainly aimed to treat the comorbid symptoms, such as epilepsy, tics, obsessive-compulsive or hyperactive behaviors (Wiznitzer, 2005). Although many efforts were invested in establishing a model of autistic pathophysiology, no such model is currently accepted, and there is no evidence for an efficient treatment of the core autistic symptoms (Wiznitzer, 2005).||Previous studies indicate that many brain systems are involved in the expression of autism. Specifically, it has been suggested that autism involves neurotransmitter dysregulations (Lam et al, 2006).

These symptoms are associated with increased social deficits, depression, irritability, and stereotyped and self-injurious behaviors. Children and adolescents with anxiety also frequently avoid potentially stressful situations, thereby missing opportunities to learn important new skills. Despite the significant consequences of anxiety symptoms, several critical treatment-relevant issues remain unresolved. First, there is a lack of clarity about how to differentiate ASD and anxiety symptoms. Second, little is known about how anxiety manifests in those with ASD and intellectual disability (ID). Third, the neural substrates of anxiety in ASD are poorly understood. The overarching goal of this project is to investigate these open issues in order to make interventions more precise, more personalized, and more likely to promote positive outcomes -- an objective consistent with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Roadmap, Precision Medicine, and Research Domain Criteria Project (RDoC) Initiatives and the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) Strategic Plan, Chapter 4.||While there is no doubt that anxiety is a very serious issue for those with ASD, what to do about this problem is less clear. The search for empirically-validated treatments has begun with multiple small trials providing promising evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) might reduce anxiety in those with ASD. However, this work is in its early stages. There is a great need for large, rigorously designed trials that validate the effectiveness of both medication and CBT, as well as functional neuroimaging studies that identify neural predictors of treatment efficacy and markers of therapy-induced change. Such work holds the potential to help answer the questions posed above and to assist the field in developing more personalized treatments. In Project 1 of the Center for the Development of Phenotype-Based Treatments of Autism Spectrum Disorder, we will conduct a study in children with ASD and clinically significant anxiety ages 8-14 to compare efficacy of these different treatment types.||The overall aims of the study are to better characterize the sub-group of children and preadolescents with ASD that exhibit clinically significant anxiety and fears through a 16-week randomized comparative treatment trial of Behavioral Intervention for Anxiety in Children with Autism (BIACA), sertraline, and placebo in youth with ASD, IQ>50, and clinically significant anxiety as assessed by a PARS score that is greater than or equal to 8. Clinician-administered gold standard assays will be used of traditional DSM (Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale [PARS] and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-IV [ADIS-IV]), and nontraditional ASD related anxiety symptoms (Autism Spectrum Addendum to the ADIS [ASDD]), as well as parent reports of potentially overlapping symptoms that complicate the ASD anxiety phenotype.

Cannabidiol (CBD), a compound originally derived from the cannabis plant but without the psychoactive effects found in cannabis, has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of children with severe epilepsy. Two non-controlled studies using CBD from local sources have demonstrated improvements in behavior in children with autism. Parents of autistic children have been using CBD products in an unregulated fashion with unknown dosing with anecdotal reports of improved behavior. This study will use EPIDIOLEX (EPX), a purified CBD oral solution that was FDA approved in June 2018 to treat severe forms of pediatric epilepsy. Study subjects will be 30 boys between 7 and 14 years of age with autism who have severe behavior problems. Every child will undergo baseline clinical evaluation, neuropsychological, behavioral, cognitive, and language testing, will have a test of brain wave activity (EEG) and a brain MRI scan. parents will complete questionnaires on various aspects of their child's behavior. Fifteen children will receive CBD for 8 weeks and 15 will receive a placebo that looks and tastes similar to the CBD (Period 1). All of the baseline tests and questionnaires will then be repeated. After a 4 week washout period, behavioral and cognitive tests and questionnaires will be repeated and then the treatments will be reversed (Period 2). At the end of 8 weeks, all of the baseline tests and questionnaires will be repeated. Study personnel and parents will be blinded to the treatment status of each child. Statistical analyses will be used to determine whether there are significant differences between baseline testing and results after placebo or CBD treatment. Types and severities of adverse events will be tracked to provide information about the safety and tolerability of CBD in this population.

Some of these children spend very little time in the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep. Some studies suggest that less time in REM sleep can be associated with learning and behavior problems. Donepezil is a medication used to treat Alzheimer s disease. Donepezil can increase REM sleep in some adults with different disorders. A small study showed that Donepezil can also increase REM sleep in children with ASD. Researchers now want to see if Donepezil can improve communication skills and social interaction in children with ASD. They also want to see if any change in symptoms seems to come from changes in REM sleep.||Objectives:||- To see if a medication, Donepezil, can improve the way communication skills and social interaction develop in young children with autism spectrum disorders.||Eligibility:||- Children 22 to 44 months of age with ASD.||Design:||Participants will be screened with a blood test, heart tests, and a sleep study.

In contrast to the ABC-Lethargy subscale it eliminates question 3 (listless, sluggish, inactive), question 32 (sits or stands in one position for a long time), and question 53 (inactive, never moves spontaneously). Thirteen individual items are scored 0-3, therefore the range is 0-39. Higher score indicates lower social reciprocity. Repeated measures were obtained at baseline, weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24.|The ABC-mSW is described above and involves 13 items reflecting lack of reciprocal interaction. Each item is scored from 0 (never shows behavior) to 3 (behavior is a major problem). The range is 0-39. Higher scores indicate worse reciprocal social functioning.|The Sociability Factor (SF) is a summed measure of the13 items of the ABC-SW and the 18 items of the Pervasive Development Disorders Behavior Inventory-Screening Version (PDDBI-SV).The PDDBI-SV assesses both adaptive social behaviors and social problems typical of ASD. The adaptive behaviors are reverse scored so that all the analyzed scores range from 0-performing in a neurotypical fashion to 3 typically performs in a way associated with ASD. the total # of items on this summed measure is 31 with a range from 0 to 93. More impaired social functioning indicated by higher scores. This measure was changed to a secondary outcome in the final statistical analysis plan.|The SRS-Social Motivation subscale was developed to provide a quantitative measure of social impairments typically observed in ASD in children 3-18 years.

However, there is previous research conducted that has indicated that after administration of oxytocin, adults with ASD demonstrated improvements in social cognition, and reduced repetitive behaviours and anxiety. There is also early research to suggest that children may also benefit in these areas.

The Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator of this study have previously documented: 1) an association between ASD and a single nuclear polymorphism of the oxytocin receptor gene, 2) ability to measure oxytocin levels in the blood by enzyme immunoassay and 3) preliminary data to support safety and efficacy of intranasal oxytocin in the treatment of social deficits and repetitive behaviors in adults with autism. A medication treatment targeting the core deficits of ASD in childhood is highly valuable because it could influence the developmental trajectory and make further psychosocial interventions possible.

The PARS Symptom Checklist consists of 50 items assessing 6 categories of anxiety symptoms, with severity scores > 14 consistent with clinically significant levels of anxiety in youth with and without ASD. Our data (Storch et al., 2012) in youth with ASD and anxiety suggest excellent psychometric properties. The PARS will be conducted over the phone by the IE with the primary parent participating in the study, with administration time of about 20 minutes.

Difficulty with social interactions is characteristic of people with autism, who often have problems interpreting facial expressions or maintaining eye contact while talking with someone. There are currently no effective medicines available to treat social problems in individuals with autism. Neuropeptides, such as vasopressin and oxytocin, are molecules used by neurons in the brain to communicate with one another. Vasopressin is closely related to oxytocin, which is currently being tested as a treatment for autism, and has been shown to enhance social functioning in animals. Animal studies have shown that when the proper functioning of vasopressin is experimentally altered, animals develop a variety of social deficits, including impaired memory for peers and a reduced interest in social interaction. Researchers found that when vasopressin was administered to mice with a genetically induced form of autism, their social functioning improved. Vasopressin is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in humans, and has proved to be a successful treatment for some common pediatric conditions, including bedwetting. Similar to oxytocin, it also has been shown to improve social cognition and memory in people who do not have autism. The researchers will test the effects of vasopressin on social impairments in 50 boys and girls with autism, ages 6 to 12 years old. The study will last four weeks for each participant. Participants will receive either vasopressin or a placebo nasal spray. At the end of this phase of the study, those who received the placebo will have the option of participating in a four-week trial during which they will be given vasopressin.

The scale was previously adapted from the 2007 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS). In the pre-intervention survey autistic participants were asked to think about their last visit with their primary care provider. We did not assess patient-provider communication for those who were participating via a proxy as we did not feel that a proxy could adequately rate how satisfied the patient was with communication. Only autistic participants who said they had seen their PCP since using the healthcare toolkit were re-asked these items in the post-intervention survey. Responses used a 5-point Likert scale with anchors of ""1 - Strongly Disagree"" to ""5 - Strongly Agree"". We analyzed items by summing the responses into a composite score (range 8-40; higher scores indicate higher satisfaction). Cronbach's alpha = 0.92.|Autistic participants were presented with a list of 16 barriers to healthcare and asked which ones keep them from obtaining good care. We compared the total number of barriers endorsed by participants in the pre- and post-intervention surveys. The proxy version of the survey included a few modified items to differentiate between barriers faced by the autistic individuals and those faced by the supporter. Due to differences in the wording, we could not combine results from those who participated directly with those who participated by proxy. Only data from autistic adults who participated directly is shown.|Autistic participants completed a 21-item healthcare self-efficacy scale before and 1 month after use of the toolkit. The scale was created de novo for this study, based on our prior qualitative work. Items addressed aspects related to healthcare navigation (e.g. ""How confident are you that you can make an appointment with your healthcare provider when needed?""), successful interactions with providers, (e.g. ""How confident are you that you can describe your symptoms or healthcare concerns to your provider?""), and self-management (e.g. ""How confident are you that you can take medications the way you are supposed to take them?""). Response options used a 4-point Likert scale with anchors of ""0 - Not at all confident"" to ""3 - Totally confident"". We scored self-efficacy by adding responses from the 21 items, resulting in a possible range of 0 to 63, with higher scores corresponding to higher self-efficacy.

Subjects will be chosen at random to receive either IGF-1 or placebo during the first treatment period and then switch to the alternate medication for the second treatment period. Therefore, by completion of the trial, all subjects will have received treatment with IGF-1 for 20 weeks. The study will be double-blinded; meaning, neither subjects' families nor study investigators will know who is receiving IGF-1 or placebo at any time. Treatment must be administered by the caregiver twice daily through subcutaneous (just underneath the skin) injections. Caregivers will be trained by research nurses in how to administer the medication. Participation in this study will last approximately eighteen months.||Throughout the course of the trial, investigators will collect information to assess the effects of IGF-1 and monitor for safety. Families must attend study visits at Boston Children's Hospital a total of seven times (including the screening visit) over the course of 18 months. These visits cannot be completed at any other hospital. Parents will fill out questionnaires and undergo a structured interview reporting on their child's health, behavior, and mood. Subjects will undergo clinical and physical examinations by a study doctor. Non-invasive devices and cameras will also be used to monitor things like breathing, hand movements, heart rate, and body temperature. Blood and urine will be collected for routine laboratory tests to monitor for safety. Investigators will also monitor safety by asking parents to complete a medication diary and side effect reporting form on a regular basis. Between trips to Boston Children's Hospital, parents will complete a set of online questionnaires and undergo a structured interview over the phone.||The cost of travel and lodging during research-related visits to and from the hospital will not be covered by the study. If a condition or illness is identified during the trial (and is determined to be unrelated to study treatments), referrals to outside medical care will be made. Study medications and all research-related materials and services will be provided at no cost to participants. Parking vouchers will be provided for all study-related hospital visits.||The study is investigating 5 potential effects:||IGF-1 may improve subjects' behavior, communication and/or mood. In order to measure this, investigators will evaluate subjects every 5 weeks throughout each treatment period with behavioral and psychological assessments. All of the tests used during these evaluations are non-invasive. Investigators will ask parents what their impressions are about their child's behavior and day-to-day activities through a structured parental interview and various questionnaires.|Investigators will examine subjects' brain function through use of a brain- monitoring device known as electroencephalography (EEG). The EEG measurements will be taken while investigators present subjects with exercises to stimulate their vision and hearing. EEG is a non-invasive way of recording the electrical activity of a subject's brain by applying a net of monitors (electrodes) to their scalp. Through this method investigators gain insight into how brain processes visual and auditory stimulus.|As one of the features of RTT is unstable vital signs, investigators are trying to determine if IGF-1 has any effect on normalizing subjects' heart rate and breathing patterns. To measure this, investigators will ask subjects to wear a non-invasive device that includes three electrocardiogram connectors and two stretchy bands that wrap around her chest and abdomen to measure heart rate and respiratory patterns.|The safety of IGF-1 in children with RTT is very important. Investigators will ask parents to complete a medication diary and side effect reporting form on a regular basis. In addition, laboratory tests will be performed every 10 weeks throughout each treatment period to evaluate the safety of IGF-1. These will be blood tests similar to those provided in typical clinical care. Subjects will undergo regular non-invasive comprehensive physical and neurological examinations, tonsil evaluation, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, scoliosis x-ray, bone age x-ray, ophthalmological exam, and measurements of height, weight and head circumference.|Children with RTT often experience unintended, stereotyped hand movements. The Qsensor® is a non-invasive device worn on a fabric bracelet that continually measures subjects' movement. Investigators will use the Qsensor® to determine whether or not IGF-1 affects the presentation of stereotyped hand movements. As such, investigators will ask subjects to wear the Qsensor® during study visits every 10 weeks throughout each treatment period and occasionally at home.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Diagnosis of ""classic"" (or ""typical"") Rett Syndrome|Genetic documentation of MECP2 mutation|Subject must be post-regression (Hagberg Stage 2)|Subject and caregiver's primary language must be English|Subject must reside in North America (US and Canada)|Caregiver must have internet access and be able to complete questionnaires online and communicate via email|Subject is stable on current medications for at least 4 weeks|Subject's regimen of non-pharmacological interventions (physical therapy, speech therapy, etc.) is stable for at least 90 days||Exclusion Criteria:||Severe scoliosis (curvature >40 degrees)|Bone-age greater than 11 years|Cardiomegaly (enlarged heart)|Tanner stage 2 or higher breast development|Allergy to IGF-1|Prior use of IGF-1, growth hormone, or sex steroids",30.0,Actual,0|0|0,30|30|30,0.0,80 weeks (from screening visit to 12-week follow up phone call).,,Female,No,,Treatment Period 1|Treatment Period 2|Treatment Period 1|Treatment Period 2,622,Subjects will receive twice daily subcutaneous injections of IGF-1.|Subjects will receive twice daily subcutaneous injections of a saline solution (placebo).,Recombinant Human Insulin Growth Factor 1 (rhIGF-1)|Placebo,mecasermin [rDNA] injection|Increlex|saline,Drug|Drug,Yes,,"March 26, 2018",Actual,"March 23, 2018",OTHER,Boston Children's Hospital,Boston,,,United States,Boston Children's Hospital,Massachusetts,,10 Years,2 Years,622,NCT02996708,,OTHER,Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,622,,15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|14|14|14|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|14|14|14|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|14|14|14|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|14|14|14|15|15|13|13|15|15|11|11|15|15|14|15|11|13|15|15|13|12|14|14|9|12|15|15|12|13|15|15|11|11|15|15|14|15|11|13|15|15|13|12|14|14|9|12|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|14|14|14|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|14|14|14|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|14|14|14|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|14|14|14|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|14|14|14|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|14|14|14|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|14|14|14|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|14|14|14|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|14|14|14|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|14|14|14|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|14|14|14|15|15|15|14|15|15|15|13|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|14|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|14|15|15|14|14|14|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|14|15|15|14|14|14|14|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|15|14|15|15|14|14|14|14|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|13|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|13|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|14|15|13|15|14|15|14|15|14|15|14|15|14|15|14,15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|15,Participants|Participants|Participants|Participants|Participants|Participants|Participants|Participants|Participants|Participants|Participants|Participants|Participants|Participants|Participants|Participants|Participants,One half of subjects will be randomly assigned to receive placebo during the first arm of the study.

The higher the value, the worse the symptom.|The Kerr clinical severity scale (Kerr scale) is a quantitative measure of global disease severity. The Kerr scale is a summation of individual items related to Rett syndrome phenotypic characteristics. The items are based on the severity or degree of abnormality of each characteristic on a discrete scale (0, 1, 2) with the highest level corresponding to the most severe or most abnormal presentations.||The possible range of scores is 0-48. The higher the score, the more severe the symptoms.|The RSBQ is a parent-completed measure of abnormal behaviors typically observed in individuals with RTT. Each item, grouped into eight subscales, is scored on a Likert scale of 0-2, according to how well the item describes the individual's behavior. A score of ""0"" indicates the described item is ""not true,"" a score of ""1"" indicates the described item is ""somewhat or sometimes true,"" and a score of ""2"" indicates the described item is ""very true or often true.""||The total sum of each subscale is reported. The higher the score, the more severe the symptoms of that subscale in the participant.||The range for each subscale is as follows:||General Mood: 0-16 Body rocking and expressionless face: 0-14 Hand behaviors: 0-12 Breathing Problems: 0-10 Repetitive Face Movements: 0-8 Night-time behaviors: 0-6 Walking Standing: 0-4||The fear/anxiety subscale was used as a primary outcome measure in this study and results can be found in that section.|Remaining subscales of the ADAMS that are not primary outcome measures include: Manic/hyperactive, Depressed mood, General anxiety, Obsessive/compulsive behavior.||The range for each subscale is as follows:||Manic/Hyperactive Behavior: 0-15 Depressed Mood: 0-21 General Anxiety: 0-21 Obsessive/Compulsive Behavior: 0-9||The higher the score for each subscale, the more problematic the behavior.|The MSEL is a standardized developmental test for children ages 3 to 68 months consisting of five subscales: gross motor, fine motor, visual reception, expressive language, and receptive language.||The raw score is reported for each subscale domain. The potential score ranges are as follows:||Visual Reception: 33 items, score range=0-50, Fine Motor: 30 items, score range= 0-49, Receptive Language: 33 items, score range= 0-48, Expressive Language: 28 items, score range= 0-50. The gross motor subscale was not included in this population.||A higher raw score indicates more advanced abilities in that section.|The VABS-II is a survey designed to assess personal and social functioning. Within each domain (Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, and Motor Skills), items can given a score of ""2"" if the participant successfully performs the activity usually; a ""1"" if the participant successfully performs the activity sometimes, or needs reminders; a ""0"" if the participant never performs the activity, and a ""DK"" if the parent/caregiver is unsure of the participant's ability for an item.||The raw scores in each sub-domain are reported and the ranges for these are as follows: [Communication Domain], Receptive Language=0-40, Expressive Language=0-108, Written Language=0-50; [Daily Living Skills Domain], Personal=0-82, Domestic=0-48, Community=0-88; [Socialization Domain], Interpersonal Relationships=0-76, Play and Leisure Time=0-62, Coping Skills=0-60; [Motor Skills Domain]: Gross Motor Skills=0-80, Fine Motor Skills=0-72.||A higher score indicates more advanced abilities.|The CSBS-DP was designed to measure early communication and symbolic skills in infants and young children (that is, functional communication skills of 6 month to 2 year olds). The CSBS-DP measures skills from three composites: (a) Social (emotion, eye gaze, and communication); (b) Speech (sounds and words); and (c) Symbolic (understanding and object use) and asks about developmental milestones. The data reported are the composite scores for these three categories.||The possible scores for the three composite categories are as follows:||Social Composite = 0-48; Speech Composite = 0-40; Symbolic Composite = 0-51.||A higher score indicates more advanced abilities in that area.|The ABC-C is a global behavior checklist implemented for the measurement of drug and other treatment effects in populations with intellectual disability. Behavior based on 58 items that describe various behavioral problems.||Each item is rated on the parents perceived severity of the behavior. The answer options for each item are:||0 = Not a problem||= Problem but slight in degree|= Moderately serious problem|= Severe in degree||The measure is broken down into the following subscales with individual ranges as follows:||Subscale I (Irritability): 15 items, score range = 0-45 Subscale II (Lethargy): 16 items, score range = 0-48 Subscale III (Stereotypy): 7 items, score range = 0-21 Subscale IV (Hyperactivity): 16 items, score range = 0-48 Subscale V (Inappropriate Speech) was not included in the breakdown because it was not applicable (no participants in the study had verbal language).|Respiratory data was collected using non-invasive respiratory inductance plethysmography from a BioCapture® recording device. BioCapture® is a child-friendly measurement device that can record from 1 to 12 physiological signal transducers in a time-locked manner. It can be configured with the pediatric chest and abdominal plethysmography bands and the 3 lead ECG signals we plan to use for monitoring cardiac safety throughout the study. Each transducer is placed on the patient independently to provide a customized fit that yields the highest signal quality for each patient irrespective of body shape and proportion. The transducer signals captured by the BioCapture® are transmitted wirelessly to a laptop computer where all signals are displayed in real-time.||The apnea index is given as apneas/hour. Data on apneas greater than or equal to 10 seconds are displayed below.

Neuroscience Center",July 2016,Actual,"The RSBQ is an informant/parent-completed measure of abnormal behaviors typically observed in individuals with RTT, which is completed by a parent/caregiver/LAR. Each item, grouped into eight domains/factors: General mood, Breathing problems, Body rocking and expressionless face, Hand behaviors, Repetitive face movements, Night-time behaviors, Fear/anxiety and Walking/standing), is scored on a Likert scale of 0-2, according to how well the item describes the individual's behavior. A score of ""0"" indicates the described item is ""not true,"" a score of ""1"" indicates the described item is ""somewhat or sometimes true,"" and a score of ""2"" indicates the described item is ""very true or often true.""||The total sum of items in each subscale is reported.||For the fear/anxiety subscale, the sum total could be between 0-8. The higher the sum total score, the greater the frequency of fear/anxiety behaviors.|The ADAMS is completed by the parent/caregiver/LAR and consists of 29 items which are scored on a 4-point rating scale that combines frequency and severity ratings. The instructions ask the rater to describe the individual's behavior over the last six months on the following scale: ""0"" if the behavior has not occurred, ""1"" if the behavior occurs occasionally or is a mild problem, ""2"" if the behavior occurs quite often or is moderate problem, or ""3"" if the behavior occurs a lot or is a severe problem.||The Social Avoidance subscale of the ADAMS will be used as a primary outcome measure for this trial. The range for this subscale is 0-21. The higher the subscale score, the more problematic the behavior.|This scale is used to judge the severity of the subject's disease prior to entry into the study. The clinician will rate the severity of behavioral symptoms at baseline on a 7-point scale from not impaired to the most impaired.||The scores that correspond to each possible grouping are as follows: 1=Normal, not at all impaired; 2=Borderline impaired; 3=Mildly impaired; 4=Moderately impaired; 5=Markedly impaired; 6=Severely impaired; 7=The most impaired.||The possible range for reported scores is 1-7.|Each time the patient was seen after the study intervention was initiated, the clinician compared the patient's overall clinical condition to the CGI-S score obtained at the baseline (visit 1) visit. Based on information collected, the clinician determined if any improvement occurred on the following 7-point scale: 1=Very much improved since the initiation of treatment; 2=Much improved; 3=Minimally improved; 4=No change from baseline (the initiation of treatment); 5=Minimally worse; 6=Much worse; 7=Very much worse since the initiation of treatment.||The possible range for reported scores is 1-7.|The PGI-S is the parent version of the CGI-S.

Oxytocin (OT) is a neurohormone involved in both repetitive/rigid and social behaviors. This study is focusing on how a single dose of intranasal OT (IN-OT) affects cognitive rigidity and social perception tasks. Taking OT as a spray through the nose increases social and decreases repetitive behavior in some adults with ASD, and we are exploring if it helps children with ASD similarly. However, it is unclear whether every person with ASD has an abnormal OT level, and if OT affects restrictive or social behavior differently. Consequently, we aim to study whether OT treatment can be effective in treating subgroups with specific features of ASD. We will use approaches utilizing both behavioral and physiological responses to clarify the role of OT in ASD. We will develop a deeper understanding of the range of social and rigid behaviors and use that information to identify persons with ASD who would benefit from OT treatment. Potential subjects will be asked if they want to participate in two sessions in our clinical laboratory where they will get either single dose IN-OT or placebo. After receiving the substance, they will be asked to do a handful of tasks while we monitor heart rate, eye movements, and collect baseline and post intranasal blood, urine and saliva. The levels of hormones, metabolites and peptides related to or interacting with OT will be measures in the collected samples of blood plasma, urine and saliva.

This would be a novel study as there is no known safety or efficacy data for amphetamine based medications in this population. In addition, although health related quality of life and executive function are known to improve with the treatment of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in the ADHD population (Banaschewski 2013; Findling 2009; Turgay 2010), it has not been shown in the co-morbid ADHD and ASD population. ADHD is the most common pediatric neurobiological condition affecting approximately five percent of the pediatric population (Feldman 2009). ASD is being increasingly recognized as affecting a substantial amount of the pediatric population, with recent prevalence data showing 1 in 68 affected (Baio, 2014). Prior to the introduction of DSM-5 (APA, 2013), exclusion criteria precluded the diagnosis of ADHD when ASD was present. Studies have shown that 41%-71% of children with ASD also meet criteria for ADHD (Goldstein 2004, Sturm 2004,Yoshida 2004, Gadow 2006). This means that up to 1% of the population may have co-morbid ADHD and ASD. With the official recognition of this comorbidity, treatment of comorbid ADHD when ASD is also present has been increasingly recognized as an important strategy in improving executive functioning and quality of life in those affected. Studies have indicated that some of the medications commonly used to treat ADHD, are effective and safe when used in comorbid ADHD and ASD. At this time, there have been well designed studies demonstrating safety and efficacy for methylphenidate (Ghuman et al. 2009; Handen et al. 2000; Quintana et al. 1995; RUPP 2005), guanfacine XR (Posey 2004; Scahill 2015), and atomoxetine (Arnold 2006; Harfterkamp 2012).",Evaluation of the Effect and Safety of Lisdexamfetamine in Children Aged 6-12 With ADHD and Autism,suzannah.wojcik@cfpe.ca,Suzannah Wojcik Clinical Research Coordinator,Contact,October 2021,Anticipated,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|Autism Spectrum Disorder,Autism|Autism Spectrum Disorder|Hyperactivity|Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,D000006948|D000004194|D000001321|D000001289|D000067877,Hyperkinesis|Disease|Autistic Disorder|Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity|Autism Spectrum Disorder,,Single Group Assignment,None (Open Label),,629,Treatment,,,"ADHD is the most common pediatric neurobiological condition affecting approximately five percent of the pediatric population (Faraone, Stephen V., Sergeant, J. et al. 2003; Feldman & Belanger 2009). ASD is being increasingly recognized as affecting a substantial amount of the pediatric population, with recent prevalence data showing 1 in 68 affected (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2010). Prior to the introduction of DSM-5, exclusion criteria precluded the diagnosis for ADHD when ASD was present (American Psychiatric Association 2013). Studies have shown that 41%-71% of children with ASD also meet criteria for ADHD, meaning up to 1% of the population may have comorbid ADHD and ASD (Goldstein & Schewbach 2004).||With the official recognition of comorbidity, treatment of comorbid ADHD when ASD is also present has been increasingly recognized as an important strategy in decreasing ADHD symptoms, and improving executive functioning and quality of life of those affected. Studies have indicated that some of the medications (methylphenidate, guanfacine XR and atomoxetine) commonly used to treat ADHD are effective and safe when used in comorbid ADHD and ASD (Ornstein & Kollins 2012; Ghuman et al. 2009; Handen et al. 2000; Quintana et al. 1995; Posey et al. 2004; Scahill et al. 2015; M. et al. 2012). While amphetamine class compounds are amongst the first line of treatment in ADHD, the lack of studies in this population has discouraged their use in subjects with comorbid ADHD and ASD.||The lack of safety and efficacy data is problematic as it limits therapeutic options for the population of subjects with ADHD and ASD. Amphetamines and methylphenidate medications are equally considered first line treatment options for ADHD (CADDRA 2011). Some subjects may preferentially respond to one group of medications over another, therefore it is important to have clear safety and efficacy data for both therapeutic options.||A retrospective chart review of this population indicates that treatment is started with methylphenidate versus combined amphetamine/dextroamfetamine at a ratio of 2.78:1 (Stigler et al. 2004). Due to the availability of evidence of efficacy in this comorbid population, clinicians may choose to skip to what is considered a second line medication for ADHD symptomatology rather than using LDX (or another amphetamine-based ADHD medication such as dexedrine or Adderall XR) that may have a larger effect size for treating these symptoms.||LDX has been shown to be an effective treatment for ADHD in subjects 6 and above. With long lasting effectiveness shown to last up to 14 hours, it could potentially improve ADHD symptoms and overall quality of life for children and adolescents with ADHD and ASD in home, school and after-school functioning.||The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LDX in treating ADHD when ASD is co-morbid.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Male or female subject aged 6-12 years at the time of consent/assent.|Subjects parent(s) or legally authorized representative (LAR) must provide signature of informed consent, and there must be documentation of assent (if applicable) by the subject in accordance with the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guideline E6 (1996), any updates or revisions, and applicable regulations, before completing any study related procedures.|Subject and parent(s)/LAR are willing and able to comply with all of the requirements defined in the protocol.|Subject meets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-V) criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD combined presentation, inattentive presentation or hyperactive/impulsive presentation based on history and a minimum ADHD-RS score of 32 and a minimum CGI-S of 4 at baseline.|Subject meets DSM-V criteria for a diagnosis of ASD-level 1 based on history and Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS-2).|Subject has an SRS-2 total score of ≥ 70.|Subject has a Clinical Global Impressions - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score ≥ 4 at the baseline visit (visit 2)|Subject has a blood pressure measurement within 95th percentile for age, and sex (Appendix 1,1.1,2 & 2.2).

Generally, mirror responses are larger upon the observation of actions accompanied by relevant information for the observer, such as direct eye contact from the actor. In other words, 'mirroring' is adaptively modulated according to the social salience of the observed actions (i.e. it is socially adaptive).||Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are known to endure difficulties with correctly recognizing eye contact as a communicative cue. Instead, they tend to experience eye contact as stressful and arousing. It is therefore hypothesized that, upon the observation of actions combined with salient gaze cues from the actor, these mirroring processes will not be adaptively modulated in participants with ASD.||As appropriate processing of eye contact is a key aspect of (non-verbal) communicative behavior, the investigator will investigate the efficacy of a single dose of intranasal oxytocin administration for enhancing socially-adaptive mirroring in ASD. Oxytocin is a neuropeptide that acts as a regulator social brain areas. On a behavioral level, it is known to enhance the saliency of observed social cues and to improve prosocial behavior.

ASD is defined by impairments in social-communication as well as the presence of restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. ASD is frequently associated with co-occurring language delays. Currently the only well-accepted treatment for core ASD symptoms is behavior therapy such as Applied Behavioral Analysis and Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention. There is no US Food and Drug Administration approved medical therapy that addresses core ASD symptoms or the pathophysiological processes that underlie ASD.||The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a liquid form of leucovorin calcium on social and communication impairments in very young children with ASD.

There are three core symptom domains of ASD, including social deficits, repetitive behaviors and language deficits. Patients can also have associated symptoms of attentional deficits, disruptive behaviors and intellectual disability. There is currently no Food and Drug administration (FDA) approved treatment for the core symptoms of autism, but risperidone and aripiprazole have FDA approval for disruptive behaviors associated with autism.||This is a 12 week randomized double blind placebo controlled trial of Milnacipran in adults with ASD or Aspergers Syndrome.

Subjects will not be responsible for the costs of any evaluations or tests conducted as part of this study.||First, subjects will receive a psychiatric and medical evaluation by the study psychiatrist to see if she/he has any psychiatric or medical illnesses that would interfere with their ability to participate in this study. These evaluations may take up to an hour to complete. In addition, subjects will be asked to participate in a psychiatric interview designed to determine the child's diagnosis and current problem areas. The subject's parent will also be asked to fill out psychiatric questionnaires. The interview and questionnaires may take up to 4 hours to complete.||Second, urine and blood samples will be needed for routine tests two times during this study (before any study related tests are done, and at the end of the study). Two teaspoons of blood will be drawn each time. The urine sample will be analyzed in order to assess kidney function and to screen for the presence of drugs (such as cocaine, marijuana, heroin, etc.). A positive drug screen would result in the inability of the child to participate in this study. Drug screen results will be kept confidential. In addition, an electrocardiogram will be performed to determine heartbeat.||Lastly, a pregnancy test will be conducted on the urine sample if the child is female and has reached puberty. The child should not be in this study if she is pregnant or a nursing mother. A positive urine pregnancy test would cause the child to be removed from the study. If the child is sexually active, she must be using an effective method of birth control during her participation in this study. Acceptable methods of birth control are oral contraceptive medications (the administration of which must be parentally supervised), IUD, depot medication and tubal ligation.||Subjects will be assigned by chance to receive either the active medication (Galantamine) or placebo (sugar pill) for 12 weeks, much like the flip of a coin. Neither the parent/child nor the investigator will know which of the two treatments the child is receiving. The child has a 50% chance of being assigned to receive placebo during the study or the active medication, Galantamine, during the study.||The child will need to be seen weekly by the study psychiatrist for the first 4 weeks of the twelve-week study, and every other week for the remaining weeks of the study. During these visits the study psychiatrist will ask the parent for feedback on his/her child's condition and any changes that may be related to the medication, including possible side effects, such as nausea and headaches, and will check the child's condition.

A number of researchers have suggested that the neuropeptide oxytocin may be implicated in the etiology of autism.||Given the likely possibility of dysregulated oxytocin in autism, the goal of this pilot study is to investigate the long-term therapeutic effects of oxytocin in the treatment of autism. One practical issue with oxytocin is that it does not exist in a pill form. Only the intravenous form is available in the United States and this form may or may not pass the blood-brain barrier. In addition, intravenous oxytocin is not practical for treatment studies. One alternative is intranasal oxytocin; this form of administration is known to pass the blood-brain barrier, and it is easy for participants to self-administer. Although not available in the United States, we are in the process of receiving an Investigational New Drug exemption for its use and can import it from Europe.||Thus, this pilot investigation will explore daily intranasal oxytocin in the treatment of autism. Also, there are very few, if any, outcome measures to assess social functioning in the ""real world"" in the context of clinical trials; yet, this is a major target for intervention, especially in autism. Thus, a final goal of this study will be to explore the use of Event Contingent Recording to index changes in social functioning and affect. Event Contingent Recording is a methodology developed by personality/social psychologists, which allows participants to report on symptoms, affect, and behavior close in time to experience. In addition, to enabling more sensitive assessments, this methodology allows for the assessment of more diverse (e.g., at home versus work) and more detailed measurements of mood and behavior.||Finally, a portion of this study aims to perform gene expression profiling using fresh whole blood to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying oxytocin therapy and oxytocin efficacy in adults with high functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome. The systemic effects of oxytocin therapy and the molecular basis for a positive treatment response to oxytocin are not well understood. An understanding of the former may help predict those persons who may suffer side-effects from treatment and the latter may help provide easily accessible peripheral biomarkers that could predict treatment response.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Male or female outpatients 18 to 60 years of age.|Meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision.

All participants will again be administered baseline medical, behavioral, and cognitive evaluations at the end of the study in order to compare all evaluations done at baseline, the end of the 26 week treatment, and completion of the study. These comparisons will be done to assess secondary outcomes that include reductions in autistic symptoms, self-injury, and aggression, as well as improvements in cognitive function across multiple domains. Furthermore, administration of the secondary outcome measures will also allow us to better understand the sensitivity of these measures in patients with TSC during the course of a clinical trial.||Families of potentially eligible children who express interest in the study and meet prescreening criteria will be invited to attend a screening visit to determine eligibility, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and availability for eight additional study visits.

Great concern has been raised about the marked increase in the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders in the last decade. Risperidone, the most studied atypical antipsychotic used in children, has been shown to improve severe behavioral difficulties in over half of children with autism who have these difficulties. However, not all children with autism and severe behavioral problems respond to risperidone, and for a few, it has significant side effects.||Two controlled studies and numerous open-label and long term studies in children with autism spectrum disorders using the atypical antipsychotic risperidone show a significant decrease of associated serious behavioral problems. The use of atypical antipsychotics is of great concern, however, because of their significant side effects and the fact that only two-thirds of children positively respond.

We will then treat them with risperidone. Blood samples will be obtained prior to treatment and at eight weeks of treatment or study exit. At that time, efficacy will be assessed using the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I) and the Irritability subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC). Blood genomic profiles before and after risperidone treatment will be determined using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays combined with RT-PCR.||Blood genomic profiles are shown to predict medication response for disorders such as cancer and epilepsy. This exploratory or discovery study will use blood genomic profiles before and after risperidone treatment in children with autism and severe behavioral difficulties to determine if the profiles can predict response to treatment. The ultimate goal of this line of research is to develop methods to predict which medications work for which child before initiating treatment, to predict which child might develop particular side effects, and to identify new treatment targets for future medication development.||Risperidone will be started at 0.5 mg at bedtime for 4 days and, if the current dosage is tolerated as evidenced by no more than mild sedation, no EPS or other moderate to severe AEs, and if there are continued behavioral symptoms, the dose will be increased to 1 mg at bedtime for an additional 4 days.

Due to the lack of known treatments for autism, many parents seek complementary and alternative medical (CAM) therapies hoping to help their affected child. Methylcobalamin (methyl B12) is a commonly used CAM treatment that has anecdotal reports of remarkable clinical improvements with few side effects. Prior studies have found that children with autism have deficiencies in key metabolites and antioxidants which can be caused by methyl B12 deficiency; additional studies have shown that methyl B12 normalizes deficiencies in these metabolites and antioxidants. Based on these reports, a pilot study was conducted at UC Davis on the effect of methyl B12 on the behavioral and metabolic measures in children with autism. The preliminary results of 29 subjects revealed a subgroup of 9 responders to clinical behavior assessments.

The core symptoms of ASD are deficits in social communication and the presence of repetitive and restricted behaviours and interests, including sensory anomalies. Currently, there are no effective medical treatments for the core symptoms of ASD, and families frequently use costly non evidence based interventions. Developing drugs for ASD has been challenging because of a limited understanding of its underlying pathophysiology(ies), and difficulties modelling it in vitro and in vivo.||A recent study from EU-AIMS reported, for the first time in ASD, that differences in E-I balance can be 'shifted' using a GABA acting drug (riluzole), and that abnormalities in functional connectivity can be 'normalised' by targeting E-I, even in adults. This offers promise that drugs targeting specific parts of the GABA pathway may improve symptoms.||The aim of the investigator's project is to conduct a double-blind Randomized Control Trial (RCT) focused on GABA/glutamate equilibrium, to assess the efficacy of a drug that targets core and/or comorbid symptoms in ASD. Arbaclofen is a selective GABA-B receptor agonist and augments GABA-ergic activity, inhibits presynaptic release of glutamate, inhibits postsynaptic transmission, and modulates intracellular signalling. Through elevation of GABA-ergic inhibitory activity, Arbaclofen may act to alleviate ASD symptoms with social anxiety and emotional hyperarousal.||Hypothesis: Arbaclofen will be superior to placebo in improving social function as measured by the Vineland-3 social domain.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Signed Written Informed Consent||Participants or their legal representative must have signed and dated an IRB/IEC approved written informed consent form in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines.

Behavioral problems increase social impairment in children with ASD, make interventions more difficult and place considerable strain on families and caregivers. Current treatment is based on behavioral interventions combined with atypical antipsychotics which often have low tolerability and questionable efficacy.||Cannabis exerts profound effects on human social behavior. Research using animal models of ASD indicate a possible dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system, and stress that it may be a novel target for pharmacological interventions.

Approximately 10 Canadian children per 10 000 live births suffer from the disorder, which is three to four times more common in males than in females. It is characterized by social and and communicative deficits and restricted, repetitive interests and behaviours. Most autistic children are delayed in the acquisition of both verbal and non-verbal communication skills and many never develop useful language. Three-quarters of autistic children have mild to severe mental retardation and a quarter develop seizures during later childhood or adolescence. Its etiology is heterogenous and there is no cure. Although behaviour therapy is an important tool in management, pharmacotherapy remains a necessity for many children. Current therapy is limited to antipsychotic drugs that can carry an unacceptable risk of chronic neurotoxicity (tardive dyskinesia) or tricyclic antidepressants that have undesireble cardiovascular effects. This study proposes to evaluate the potential benefit of selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in autism.||All autistic children whose symptoms are not currently well controlled will be offered entry into the trial.

SPECIFIC AIMS||To investigate the safety of clinical use of ziprasidone in children|To investigate the dosages that have been employed clinically.||II. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE||Ziprasidone, a recently released atypical agent is likely to be as effective as other neuroleptics in treating psychiatric symptoms in children, but may have the considerable health advantage of not causing weight gain. Ziprasidone administration has been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval (mean=20 msec), an electrocardiographic measure of ventricular repolarization (Federal Drug Administration, 2000). There are no reports regarding the use of ziprasidone in autism, and data regarding the safety and efficacy of ziprasidone in children is extremely limited. The only published study of ziprasidone in children found that it was safe and effective in treating Tourette's syndrome in children aged 7 to 17 years of age (Sallee et al, 2000). Because children are being treated with ziprasidone despite a paucity of safety data, it is important to begin to collect and review available data, including that from clinical usage. Some children who receive services within the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Services of Drexel University College of Medicine have been treated with ziprasidone. The charts of the children and adolescents will contain data regarding exposure to ziprasidone and laboratory data and ECG's that can be reviewed to determine whether ziprasidone treatment has been associated with changes in weight, laboratory values and ECG's. We propose to review the charts of patients who have been treated with our services since March 1, 2001 XXX because such patients may have been exposed to ziprasidone (ziprasidone received FDA approval on February 5, 2001).||III. DESIGN AND METHODS||A. Setting: The setting for this study will be the Specialty Clinic for Pervasive Developmental Disorders, part of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic at Eastern Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute.||B. Subjects: Subjects will be 15 children and adolescents who meet the DSM-IV Criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorder.||C. Design: This is a 6-week pilot study employing open treatment with ziprasidone. Subjects will be rated at baseline and thereafter assessed weekly.||D. Medication: Subjects will be treated openly with ziprasidone. Should untoward effects occur, the dosage of the medication will be reduced or the medication will be discontinued, as clinically appropriate. Subjects will not receive other concomitant psychotropic medication during the study. Medication will be taken concomitant with food.||Ziprasidone Dosing Strategy: Ziprasidone tablets (5, 10, and 20 mg) will be employed for the study. The dosage range for ziprasidone will be 5 mg/day to 40 mg/day. Every effort will be made to reach and maintain a therapeutic dosage by week four of the treatment phase.||For subjects who weigh less than 25 kg, starting dosage will be 5 mg/every other day. After 3 days, the dosage can be increased to 5 mg. By week 2, subjects can be increased to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 20 mg increments weekly.|For subjects who weigh greater than 25 kg, the starting dosage will be 5 mg/day. After three days, the dosage can be increased to 10 mg/day. By week two, subjects can be increased to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 20 mg increments weekly as needed.||Note: Should 5 mg tablets not be available, the dosing schedule will be altered to have a starting dosage of 10 mg, and dosage increases will be made in 10 mg increments.||F. Measures||Primary efficacy measure: The Clinical Global Impressions (CGI; Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The efficacy of treatments can be judged on their ability to enhance global functioning, an assessment that is particularly relative in a pilot study. The CGI consists of three global scales measuring severity of illness, global improvement, and drug effect, and has been useful in measuring drug treatment effect in this population (see Campbell and Palij, 1985). The PI and another trained rater will complete this scale. Although only members of the research team generally complete this scale, it will additionally be completed by the subject's parent/caretaker. Having it completed by the parent/caretaker will take only minutes and may result in useful data. This measure will be completed weekly beginning at baseline.|Secondary efficacy measure: Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale (Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The CPRS was developed by the Psychopharmacology Branch of the NIMH to rate childhood psychopathology. Each of the items is rated from ""1"" (not present) to ""7"" (extremely severe). The first 28 items of this scale require no verbal response on the part of the subject, making them appropriate for rating children and adolescents with Pervasive Developmental Disorder. Of these 28 items, 14 are particularly relevant in autism (see Campbell and Palij, 1985): they assess the symptoms for which drug treatment is indicated including hyperactivity, aggression, self-abusive behavior, temper tantrums, lability of mood, irritability, social withdrawal, and stereotypies. A composite sum of these 14 items, the CPRS-14, will be constructed and employed as a secondary outcome measure, a procedure used by a number of investigators (Anderson et al, 1989; Campbell et al, 1986, 1989, 1993; Findling et al, 1997; Sanchez et al, 1996). We analyzed our data using the CPRS-14; the ICC was 0.8978. In addition, 4 factors derived from these 14 items will be examined. They include: autism, anger/uncooperativeness, hyperactivity, and speech deviance (Overall and Campbell, 1988). This measure will be completed at baseline and at the end of treatment.|Safety measures: (1) A physical exam will be completed at baseline. (2) Height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse will be obtained and recorded at baseline and at each visit during the study. (3) The following laboratory measures will be obtained at baseline and repeated at the end of the treatment phase: complete blood count with differential, liver functions, and electrocardiogram. Serum prolactin will be obtained at baseline and at the end of the treatment phase. These laboratory studies will be repeated at the end of the treatment phase of the study. Any other clinically appropriate tests and evaluations will also be completed whenever needed.||Untoward effects will be measured and recorded at each visit employing the following measures: (1) Dosage Record and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (DOTES); (2) Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale (TESS); (3) Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) (all from Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985); and (4) the Neurologic Rating Scale (Simpson and Angus, 1970). The DOTES and TESS measure a wide range of possible untoward effects. The AIMS measures dyskinesias. The Neurologic Rating Scale measures other forms of extrapyramidal effects that can occur with neuroleptics such as dystonias, parkinsonian effects, and akathisia.||G. Procedures: All patients appropriate to the study and their parent/caretakers will be approached and informed consent and assent (in subjects under 14 years) will be obtained. Subjects meeting the Inclusion Criteria, but not the Exclusion Criteria, will enter the baseline period of the study.||Baseline (week 0): Subjects will be rated at baseline employing the CGI and the CPRS.||End of Treatment (week 6): At the end of the treatment period, subjects will again be rated employing the CGI and the CPRS (selected items).||In addition, each subject will be rated on the CGI at each visit so that data from the last visit is available should the subject terminate the study prematurely. If it is known that a subject will terminate the study at a visit before week 6, the subject will be rated with the CGI and the CPRS at that visit.||All safety measures will be completed at each visit. Laboratory measures and EKG will be obtained in the morning.||I. Analysis: This is a pilot study whose purpose is to get initial safety and efficacy data with ziprasidone in children with autism. We will perform an ANOVA, repeated measures, for CGI severity scores, the CPRS-14 and the CPRS factors. Similar analyses will be performed for safety measures including for weight, prolactin and other laboratory measures, and EKG indices.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Diagnosis of autism (DSM-IV) made by a boarded child and adolescent psychiatrist.|Males and females.|Aged 12 to 18 years.|Clinical judgment that medication treatment for autism is indicated.||Exclusion Criteria:||Major medical problems including cardiac, liver, endocrine, or renal diseases.|History of seizure disorder or gross neurological deficit.|Baseline QTC greater than 425 msec.|Concomitant treatment with psychotropic medication.|History of prior exposure to ziprasidone.",15.0,Actual,,,,,,All,No,,1 Open Label,929,"Ziprasidone 40mg to 60mg per day, individually titrated",Ziprasidone,Geodon,Drug,,,"June 17, 2010",Estimate,"June 15, 2010",OTHER,Drexel University College of Medicine,Philadelphia,,,United States,Drexel University College of Medicine at Friends Hospital,Pennsylvania,,18 Years,12 Years,929,NCT02632773,The Role of Parent Phenotype in Parent-Mediated Language Interventions for Autism,OTHER,Northwestern University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,929,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Drexel University College of Medicine,929,"Richard P Malone, MD",Principal Investigator,Completed,Yes,Phase 2,,,,June 2005,Actual,,Clinical Global Impressions,Week 6,,,,,,,,929,,,,,1R01DC014709-01,U.S. NIH Grant/Contract,,https://projectreporter.nih.gov/reporterapi.cfm?PROJECTNUM=1R01DC014709-01&Fy=all,20 minute video of a therapist-child interaction in the clinic with a standard set of age-appropriate toys.|Parent report of child's expressive vocabulary and prelinguistic communication skills,Expressive vocabulary of the child as measured by transcribing and coding a 20 minute video of a therapist-child interaction in the clinic with a standard set of age-appropriate toys.|MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (MCDI) (Child),Two months after the start of the study|Two months after the start of the study,,,,,,,August 2015,Actual,July 2021,929,Child,"December 17, 2015",Estimate,"December 8, 2015","December 16, 2015",,Interventional,"November 04, 2021",,No

Phase 2 consists of receiving 12 weeks of folinic acid or an inactive placebo, in addition to several evaluations of your child's abilities and a single blood test.

Currently, there is no FDA approved medical therapy that addresses either core ASD symptoms or pathophysiological processes associated with ASD. For example, the two FDA approved antipsychotic medications for treating ASD are indicated for symptoms associated with ASD, not core ASD symptoms. Based on strong preliminary evidence, this study aims to improve core ASD symptoms with folinic acid. Two biological mechanisms for response to the intervention are proposed and investigated in this study.||Folate is an essential B vitamin required for normal neurodevelopment. Folinic acid is a reduced form of folate that has been shown to improve both the metabolic and core symptoms associated with ASD in an open-label study and large case-series. This study will extend this preliminary evidence to demonstrate clinical efficacy of folinic acid in a double-blind placebo-controlled manner while also evaluating the biological mechanisms associated with the clinical response.||Preliminary evidence for the efficacy of folinic acid is two-fold: First, several independent studies have demonstrated that a folinic acid intervention improves ASD core symptoms in ASD patients diagnosed with cerebral folate deficiency - a metabolic disorder in which the primary pathway for the transport of folate across the blood-brain barrier is dysfunctional. The primary transport pathway for folate across the blood-brain barrier uses the folate receptor α (FRα) and energy dependent endocytosis. A secondary pathway, the reduced folate carrier (RFC), can transport reduced forms of folate, such as folinic acid, across the blood-brain barrier. In case-series of children with ASD and cerebral folate deficiency, folinic acid (0.5 to 2 mg/kg/day) improved communication, social interaction, attention, and stereotypical behavior in some (3-6) and completely ameliorated ASD symptoms in others (6, 7).||The major cause of cerebral folate deficiency is an autoantibody that binds to the FRα and interferes with its ability to bind and transport folate. Recently, Frye et al. found that (a) autoantibodies to the FRα were present in approximately 75% of children with ASD, and (b) an intervention with folinic acid (2mg/kg/day; max 50mg) in children with ASD and FRα autoantibodies resulted in significant improvements in parental ratings of receptive and expressive language, verbal communication, stereotypic behavior, and attention as compared to parental rating for children that did not undergo any intervention (wait group) over a similar time period. This proposal will extend these preliminary findings by documenting response to a folinic acid intervention in a double-blind placebo-controlled manner and test whether FRα autoantibody titers predict response to a folinic acid intervention. If FRα autoantibody titers are found to predict response to the intervention, such titers could provide a biomarker to identify a subset of children with ASD that may benefit from a folinic acid intervention and may even predict the development of ASD symptoms in high risk siblings during the presymptomatic period.||Second, the ratio of reduced-to-oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) is an established measure of systemic redox status and oxidative stress that has been shown in three independent case-control studies to be significantly decreased in many ASD children. James et al. have shown in a 3 month open-label clinical trial that an intervention of folinic acid and methyl-B12 significantly improved GSH/GSSG and Vineland scores for expressive language, receptive language, and socialization in ASD children. Important unanswered questions are (a) whether this preliminary data can be confirmed in a larger double-blind placebo-controlled study, (b) whether redox status before the folinic acid intervention can predict response to intervention and (c) whether improved systemic redox status is associated with improvement in core ASD symptoms.||This study will assess whether a folinic acid intervention can improve both core symptoms of ASD (i.e., communication, socialization, stereotyped movements) and associated comorbid symptoms (i.e., attention) in a double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial. This study will address whether improvements in core ASD symptoms associated with the intervention are related to biomarkers of either (or both) biological mechanisms proposed to be influenced by the intervention (i.e., GSH/GSSG, FRα autoantibody titer). Thus, using these biomarkers, it may be possible that children with ASD who optimally respond to the folinic acid intervention can be readily identified early after diagnosis or even during the pre-symptomatic period.||This double blind, placebo-controlled (DBPC) study will evaluate the efficacy of Folinic Acid for the treatment of language impaired autism spectrum disorder patients aged 3-14 years. The study will consist of a single site trial with approximatley 48 entering the DBPC phase. Subjects will be male or female with current or prospective diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Language Impairments will be defined by the CELF, or PLS when warranted.||Phase 1 will consist of approximately 57children aged 3-14 with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (as defined by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule or the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised), until approximately 48 children with confirmed ASD are enrolled into a randomized control trial (RCT; Phase 2). Enrollment will continue as needed until approximately 43 complete Phase 2. Approximately 40 will enroll into phase 3.||Initial analyses will be undertaken to inspect data for errors, inconsistencies, and incomplete information. This will include examining the data with simple frequency tables and dot plots for univariate data and scatter plots and multi-way dot plots with bivariate and multivariate data. To summarize bivariate relationships among predictors and between predictors and outcomes, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient will be used. For reporting inferential statistics, regression coefficients along with the 95 percent confidence intervals will be used extensively to quantify degree of clinical importance.||The primary population will be the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population and is defined as all subjects who have completed at least one post treatment primary outcome measure. A secondary analysis will be performed on the ""as treated"" population defined as those subjects who had at least 75% compliance of prescribed medications and have not significantly deviated from the protocol.||To determine whether the folinic acid intervention over a 12-week period improves core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder in Phase 2, the procedure Proc Mixed in SAS will be used to fit a mixed model analysis of covariance. For the multisite study, the full model with the response variable language assessment will include predictors such as: intervention, time, autoantibody, intervention by time interaction, autoantibody by intervention interaction, redox status, redox status by time interaction, and baseline covariates. However, for the single site study, the number of variables in the model will be limited due to the smaller sample size and separate models will be performed on subgroups to compare the effects of the treatment in various subgroups. The results from the mixed model will determine if the biomarkers of physiological abnormalities, both autoantibodies and redox status, predict intervention response. Similar analysis will be performed for the secondary outcomes.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria||1.

The biologic actions of oxytocin on social cognition and prosocial behaviors and the clinical, genetic and epigenetic evidence for involvement of the oxytocin system in the pathophysiology of some cases of autism strongly suggest that supplemental oxytocin therapy could significantly improve the social disabilities involved in autism.

The efficacy of each dose will be evaluated using behavioral, cognitive and physiological metrics. If individual subject results suggest that either of the oxytocin dosage levels (24 IU or 48 IU) is superior to placebo in the double-blind phase, a single-blind trial using the optimal dosage of oxytocin will then be administered daily for 14 days by parents at home.

There is presently no cure for FXS.

SPECIFIC AIM||To obtain pilot data regarding the safety, dosing, and efficacy of open-labeled aripiprazole in children, aged 12 to 18 years, diagnosed with autism. A larger, more controlled trial will be planned for this population if the drug is safe and tends to be efficacious.||II. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE||Autism is a serious disorder that first presents in childhood, usually before three years of age (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Though the incidence of autism is low (approximately 3-6 cases per 10,000 live births), the consequences of the disorder are severe. As the term ""pervasive"" implies, the symptoms affect most areas of functioning in the developing child, and the disabilities associated with the disorder tend to persist throughout life. Symptoms of autism include abnormalities in social relatedness including extreme withdrawal; communication including no or little speech; and a sameness or repetitiveness in behaviors and interests. Children diagnosed with autism can have severe problems including hyperactivity, lability of mood, irritability, withdrawal, and stereotypical behavior. Because of these severe problems, treatment of symptomatology often includes pharmacotherapy.||The most studied drug for treating children and adolescents with autism is the typical neuroleptic, haloperidol (Anderson et al, 1989; Anderson et al, 1984; Campbell et al, 1978; and Cohen et al, 1980). The main public health concern regarding the use of haloperidol is the risk of inducing dyskinesias (Campbell et al, 1988, 1997), though the dyskinesias have been reversible.||Evidence also suggests that atypical neuroleptics, such as olanzapine (Horrigan et al, 1997b; Malone et al, 2001; Potenza et al, 1999) and risperidone (Demb, 1996; Findling et al, 1997; Fisman and Steele, 1996; Hardan et al, 1996; Horrigan et al, 1997a; Malone et al, 1999b; McDougle et al, 1997; Nicholson et al, 1998; Perry et al, 1997) are effective. But the weight gain associated with these agents can be a considerable health risk (Pi-Sunyer, 1993; Sjostrom, 1992). For example, olanzapine use has reportedly been associated with increased blood glucose (Fertig et al, 1998; Gatta et al, 1999; Ober et al, 1999; Wirshing et al, 1998; Yazici et al, 1998). Ziprasidone is associated with increases in QTc, including in children (Malone, unpublished data).||Aripiprazole, a recently released atypical agent is likely to be as effective as other neuroleptics in autism, but may have the considerable health advantage of not causing weight gain. However, because there is a lack of safety and efficacy data with aripiprazole in children with autism, an open pilot study of aripiprazole in this population is indicated.||III. DESIGN AND METHODS||A. Setting: The setting for this study will be the Specialty Clinic for Pervasive Developmental Disorders, part of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic of Drexel University College of Medicine located at Friends Hospital.||B. Subjects: Subjects will be 15 children and adolescents who meet the DSM-IV Criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorder.||C. Design: This is a 6-week pilot study employing open treatment with aripiprazole. Subjects will be rated at baseline and thereafter assessed weekly.||D. Medication: Subjects will be treated openly with aripiprazole. Should untoward effects occur, the dosage of the medication will be reduced or the medication will be discontinued, as clinically appropriate. Subjects will not receive other concomitant psychotropic medication during the study. Medication will be taken concomitant with food.||Aripiprazole Dosing Strategy: Aripiprazole tablets (10, 15, 20, and 30 mg) will be employed for the study. The dosage range for aripiprazole will be 5 mg/day to 30 mg/day. Every effort will be made to reach and maintain a therapeutic dosage by week four of the treatment phase.||For subjects who weigh less than 25 kg, starting dosage will be 5 mg/every other day. After 3 days, the dosage can be increased to 5 mg. By week 2, subjects can be increased up to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 10 mg increments weekly.|For subjects who weigh greater than 25 kg, the starting dosage will be 5 mg/day. After three days, the dosage can be increased to 10 mg/day. By week two, subjects can be increased to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 10 mg increments weekly as needed.||Note: Should 5 mg tablets not be available, the dosing schedule will employ ½ of a 10 mg tablet and dosage increases will be made in 10 mg increments. We are starting at a 5 mg dosage to avert excessive sedation at onset of drug administration.||F. Measures||Primary efficacy measure: The Clinical Global Impressions (CGI; Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The efficacy of treatments can be judged on their ability to enhance global functioning, an assessment that is particularly relative in a pilot study. The CGI consists of three global scales measuring severity of illness, global improvement, and drug effect, and has been useful in measuring drug treatment effect in this population (see Campbell and Palij, 1985). The PI and another trained rater will complete this scale. Although only members of the research team generally complete this scale, it will additionally be completed by the subject's parent/caretaker. Having it completed by the parent/caretaker will take only minutes and may result in useful data. This measure will be completed weekly beginning at baseline.|Secondary efficacy measure: Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale (Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The CPRS was developed by the Psychopharmacology Branch of the NIMH to rate childhood psychopathology. Each of the items is rated from ""1"" (not present) to ""7"" (extremely severe). The first 28 items of this scale require no verbal response on the part of the subject, making them appropriate for rating children and adolescents with Pervasive Developmental Disorder. Of these 28 items, 14 are particularly relevant in autism (see Campbell and Palij, 1985): they assess the symptoms for which drug treatment is indicated including hyperactivity, aggression, self-abusive behavior, temper tantrums, lability of mood, irritability, social withdrawal, and stereotypies. A composite sum of these 14 items, the CPRS-14, will be constructed and employed as a secondary outcome measure, a procedure used by a number of investigators (Anderson et al, 1989; Campbell et al, 1986, 1989, 1993; Findling et al, 1997; Sanchez et al, 1996). We analyzed our data using the CPRS-14; the ICC was 0.8978. In addition, 4 factors derived from these 14 items will be examined. They include: autism, anger/uncooperativeness, hyperactivity, and speech deviance (Overall and Campbell, 1988). This measure will be completed at baseline and at the end of treatment.|Safety measures: (1) A physical exam will be completed at baseline. (2) Height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse will be obtained and recorded at baseline and at each visit during the study. (3) The following laboratory measures will be obtained at baseline and repeated at the end of the treatment phase: complete blood count with differential, liver functions, and electrocardiogram. Serum prolactin will be obtained at baseline and at the end of the treatment phase. Any other clinically appropriate tests and evaluations will also be completed whenever needed.||Untoward effects will be measured and recorded at each visit employing the following measures: (1) Dosage Record and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (DOTES); (2) Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale (TESS); (3) Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) (all from Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985); and (4) the Neurologic Rating Scale (Simpson and Angus, 1970). The DOTES and TESS measure a wide range of possible untoward effects. The AIMS measures dyskinesias. The Neurologic Rating Scale measures other forms of extrapyramidal effects that can occur with neuroleptics such as dystonias, parkinsonian effects, and akathisia.||G. Procedures: All patients appropriate to the study and their parent/caretakers will be approached and informed consent and assent (in subjects under 14 years) will be obtained. Subjects meeting the Inclusion Criteria, but not the Exclusion Criteria, will enter the baseline period of the study.||Baseline (week 0): Subjects will be rated at baseline employing the CGI and the CPRS.||End of Treatment (week 6): At the end of the treatment period, subjects will again be rated employing the CGI and the CPRS (selected items).||In addition, each subject will be rated on the CGI at each visit so that data from the last visit is available should the subject terminate the study prematurely. If it is known that a subject will terminate the study at a visit before week 6, the subject will be rated with the CGI and the CPRS at that visit.||All safety measures will be completed at each visit. Laboratory measures and EKG will be obtained in the morning.||H. Analysis: This is a pilot study whose purpose is to get initial safety and efficacy data with aripiprazole in children with autism. We will perform an ANOVA, repeated measures, for CGI severity scores, the CPRS-14 and the CPRS factors. Similar analyses will be performed for safety measures including for weight, prolactin and other laboratory measures, and EKG indices.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Diagnosis of autism (DSM-IV) made by a boarded child and adolescent psychiatrist.|Males and females.|Aged 12 to 18 years.|Clinical judgment that medication treatment for autism is indicated.||Exclusion Criteria:||Major medical problems including cardiac, liver, endocrine, or renal diseases.|Uncontrolled seizures.|Baseline QTC greater than 425 msec.|Concomitant treatment with psychotropic medication.|History of prior exposure to aripiprazole.",11.0,Actual,,,,,,All,No,No,1 Open Label,992,"Aripiprazole 5 mg to 30mg, individually titrated",Aripiprazole,Abilify,Drug,,,"July 30, 2018",Actual,"July 27, 2018",OTHER,Drexel University College of Medicine,Philadelphia,,,United States,Drexel University College of Medicine at Friends Hospital,Pennsylvania,,18 Years,12 Years,992,NCT03625297,"Shelter Cat Adoption in Families of Children With Autism: Impact on Cat Stress and Children's Social Skills and Anxiety (""Feline Friends"")",OTHER,University of Missouri-Columbia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,992,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Drexel University College of Medicine,992,"Richard P Malone, MD",Principal Investigator,Completed,Yes,Phase 2,,,,"November 16, 2011",Actual,,Clinical Global Impressions,Week 6,,,,,,Sponsor,,992,,,,,,,,,bonding of parent and cat using Lexington Attachment to Pets Scale with scores from 0-54.|bonding of child with autism and cat using the Companion Animal Bonding Scale with scores from 8-40,"change in parent Human-animal Bonding over time from 2-3 days, to 6, to 12 and 18 weeks|change in child Human-animal Bonding over time from 2-3 days, to 6, to 12 and 18 weeks","Baseline, 6, 12 and 18 weeks Treatment: Baseline, 2-3 days, 6, 12 and 18 weeks|Baseline, 6, 12 and 18 weeks Treatment: Baseline, 2-3 days, 6, 12 and 18 weeks",,,,,,,"June 23, 2017",Actual,October 2020,992,Child,"August 10, 2018",Actual,"July 17, 2018","August 8, 2018",,Interventional,"November 04, 2021",,No
