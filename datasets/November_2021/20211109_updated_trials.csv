Cannabidivarin (CBDV) is a nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid and a safe variant of Cannabidiol (CBD). It has no appreciable tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) [less than 0.01%], has been shown to have no impact on weight or metabolism, and improves both social and cognitive functioning in animal models of idiopathic and syndromal autism (Fragile X, Rett Syndrome, Angelman Syndrome). The CDC currently estimates 1 in 59 children have ASD. ASD is characterized by deficits in social communication, irritability, repetitive behaviors, impulsivity, temper tantrums, and high caregiver burden. Currently, the only FDA-approved medications for symptoms of ASD are aripiprazole and risperidone, both of which are indicated for irritability in pediatric ASD. These medications are effective but are associated with considerable side effects with long term treatment in this chronic developmental disorder, including weight gain, metabolic syndrome and the risk of type 2 diabetes, prolactin elevation and growth of breast tissue, extrapyramidal symptoms and the risk of tardive dyskinesia. The anticonvulsant divalproex sodium (valproate/VPA) also significantly reduces irritability and repetitive behaviors in individuals with ASD. Although VPA is efficacious for pediatric epilepsy and some symptoms of ASD, it also has significant side effects, including weight gain, sedation and nausea. CBDV, like VPA, is effective in the treatment of pediatric epilepsy, and ASD mouse models demonstrate potential mechanisms for treatment with CBDV, including potential therapeutic effects on repetitive behaviors, irritability, sociability, and quality of life, and the capacity to reduce inflammation. This study aims to examine the efficacy and safety of cannabidivarin (CBDV) with a primary aim of studying its effect on irritability in children with ASD.||STUDY DESIGN: This is a 12-week randomized, double-blind study of CBDV vs. placebo in 100 child and adolescent subjects aged 5 to 18 years with a diagnosis of ASD.",,,,,"Inclusion Criteria||Male or Female pediatric outpatients aged between and including ages 5 to 18.
